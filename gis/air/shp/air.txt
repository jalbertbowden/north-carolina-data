  Description:
    Abstract: NCCGIA developed a GIS data set representing point locations for airports located in North Carolina.
    Purpose: These data were created to assist governmental agencies and others in making resource management decisions through use of a Geographic Information System (GIS).
    Supplemental_Information: Point locations were verified using 1998 Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quads where a runway was visible.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: In December 2003, NCCGIA  created a point shapefile from lat/longs provided by NC DOT. A shapefile was also created from data supplied by the FAA. Because there was not a common field for joining tables, NCCGIA identified FAA points that coincided with or were near a state point.  The  FAA points within 3,200 feet of a state point were selected in ArcView. These points were converted to a shapefile. Then the selection was switched to make the FAA points selected as those not near a state point.  That selection was converted to a shapefile. The two datasets were merged to fill in gaps that occured in both datasets allowing for a more complete statewide airports coverage. NCCGIA then used digital orthophotography from 1998 to verify the points. The data were intended for planning purposes and were not verified or documented for GIS.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: Using ESRI's ARC/INFO Arcview software, a point shapefile was created.
  Completeness_Report: These data represent the locations of airports in North Carolina as identified by the NC DOT and the FAA.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: For the larger airports, point locations (approximate center of airport) were verified using 1998 digital orthophoto quarter quads at 1-meter resolution.  The smallest airports were not visible on photos and not verified by other means.
