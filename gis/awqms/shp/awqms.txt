  Description:
    Abstract:
      The North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Division of
      Water Quality, in cooperation with the NC Center for Geographic Information and Analysis,
      developed the GIS data set, Ambient Water Quality Monitoring Sites data to enhance planning,
      siting, and impact analysis in areas directly affecting water quality. This file identifies
      locations in North Carolina where water quality data are collected on a routine basis and
      analyzed for presence of various chemicals.
    Purpose:
      This data was created to assist governmental agencies and others in making resource
      management decisions through use of a Geographic Information System (GIS).

      >3.)  filename: awqms900  The September 30 2000 update consisted of
      >CGIA receiving from DWQ an EXCEL spreadsheet that listed active
      >ambient water quality monitoring stations. This database contained
      >corrections to many of the sites from the original database.
      >Additionally, many stations were moved, discontinued, or added since
      >the original database.  NC Division of Water Quality has changed the
      >process by which station locations are mapped. With the submission
      >of this new data the layer is longer considered unverified.
      >2.) filename: uvawqms1298  The December 1998 update to this layer
      >consisted of projecting the data from NAD27 datum, State Plane

      >done in various ways depending on the data type and content.  Vector

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      The attributes contained in this data were supplied by the source agency as part of
      the digital file from their database. Data represents information as supplied. No
      additional background checks were performed.
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Using ESRI's ARC/INFO GIS software, the dataset was built for point topology using
    the "build" command. The data set was then cleaned using the "clean" command. Topology
    has not been edited since the last build or clean.
  Completeness_Report:
    This data represents information as supplied from an internal SQL database located at
    DWQ.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The Ambient Monitoring Sites were manually mapped on 24k USGS paper topographic
        maps which meet National Map Accuracy Standards, using a best estimate with
        reference to surrounding features.  Latitudes and longitudes were generated using
        a grid overlay and entered into an internal SQL database.  DWQ then converted the
        data from to an EXCEL spreadsheet for conversion to a GIS coverage.  Points were
        checked for accuracy against NC Corportae GIS Data layers.  Refinement of the
        georeferencing occurred through the use of "Terrain Navigator" software which
        generates latitude and longitude values at the location of the cursor.

      Process_Description:
        NC DENR-DWQ,WQS collected the monitoring sites data and locations in an
        internal SQL database. The point locations were interpreted from USGS
        1:24,000-scale topographic quadrangles using a grid overlay. The point
        locations and attribute data in this file was exported into an EXCEL
        spreadsheet and transferred to CGIA via e-mail for conversion to an
        ARC/INFO coverage for use with GIS software.
