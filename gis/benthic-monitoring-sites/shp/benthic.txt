  Description:
    Abstract: The North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Division of Water Quality, with funding from the NC Clean Water Management Trust Fund and in cooperation with the NC Center for Geographic Information and Analysis, developed the digital benthic monitoring data to enhance water quality assessment & plan review of Trust Fund project applications. This file identifies points where benthic macroinvertebrate monitoring has occurred. This file enables users to review the current rating of water quality for each sampling site based on the monitoring results.
    Purpose: These data were created to assist governmental agencies and others in making resource management decisions through use of a Geographic Information System (GIS).
    Supplemental_Information:
      system filename : bmr
      approx file size = 0.34 mb

      Revisions and updates to this layer include:
      2) filename: bmr900  CGIA received from DWQ an excel spreadsheet with a list of benthic monitoring sites through November 15, 2000.  This spreadsheet contained many latitude and longitude corrections from the original layer released by CGIA.  This version includes two additional attributes:  basinsite, which indicates whether a site is part of a routine sampling schedule, and sample type.
      1) filename: bmr600  The June 15, 2000 version was the
      first version released to the database.
      Original was data received and processed September 1998.
      Corrections to lat/longs were made in October 1998.
      Minor latitude attribute correction was made June 2000.
      (The coverage's projection was also defined.)

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: The NC DENR-DWQ maintained the biological records in a 4D database with no geographic reference. The database includes attributes for river basin, subbasin, site description, collection date and water quality rating. The water quality ratings are assigned based on an analysis of field samplings using standard methodologies. The database was converted to an EXCEL spreadsheet for conversion to a GIS coverage. The digital file is updated as changes occur.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: Using ESRI's ARC/INFO GIS software, the dataset was built for point topology using the "build" command. Topology has not been edited since the last "build" or "clean."
  Completeness_Report: These data represent the locations and results of the benthic macroinvertebrate sampling conducted and documented by the NCDWQ. Each point has an associated water quality rating based on the sampling results.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: The NC DENR-DWQ maintained the biological data in a 4D database with no geographic reference. The monitoring points were manually mapped onto 24k USGS paper topographic maps which meet National Map Accuracy Standards, using a best estimate with reference to surrounding features. Latitudes and longitudes were generated using a grid overlay.  Points were checked for accuracy against NC Corporate GIS Data layers. In 1998 "TopoScout" software was purchased. The software generates lat/longs for the location of the cursor. DWQ will continue to refine the georeferencing of the sampling sites. DWQ converted the 4D data into an EXCEL spreadsheet for conversion to a GIS coverage. NCCGIA converted this dataset to a GIS coverage using ESRI's ARC/INFO software on UNIX. The digital file is updated as changes occur.

  Overview_Description:
    Entity_and_Attribute_Overview:
      A point coverage depicting stream locations sampled by the Division of Water Quality, Biological Assessment Unit. Each point includes a description of its location by county,river basin, sub-basin, location, and stream name. A latitude and longitude has been designated to geographically reference each sampling point. Each point has been assigned a water quality rating or "bioclassification" based on the quality and quantity of benthic macroinvertebrate life found at that site. The ratings are assigned on a scale of poor to excellent water quality. Bioclassifications are based on the number of taxa present and the relative pollution tolerance of each taxa. Stream and river reaches are then given a final bioclassification of Excellent, Good, Good-Fair, Fair, Poor, or Not Rated. These bioclassifications, which have been developed for major ecoregions, are used to assess the various impacts of both point source discharges and non-point source runoff.
