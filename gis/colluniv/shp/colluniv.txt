    Abstract:
      Colleges and Universities in North Carolina

      The Colleges and Universities dataset is composed of any type of Post Secondary Education such as: colleges, universities, technical schools, trade schools, business schools, satellite (branch) campuses, etc. that grant First Professional, Associate, Bachelors, Masters, or Doctoral degrees.

      Text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results.

      All diacritics (e.g. the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics.

      The currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] attribute. Based upon this attribute, the oldest record dates from 07/09/2007 and the newest record dates from 07/26/2007.
    Purpose:
      Homeland Security

      Use Cases: Use cases help define and clarify requirements, and describe how the data may be used.

      1) Identification of populations that may need to be evacuated in the event of an emergency.

      2) Notification of groups of people who may be at risk from a contagious disease outbreak.

  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      For entities that were contacted, the name, address, city, state, and five (5) digit zip codes were verified to be correct as of the date indicated by the [CONTDATE] attribute. The existence of the entity was also verified, as well as whether or not it met the criteria for inclusion in this dataset. Four (4) digit zip code extensions were derived from USPS (United States Postal Service) data and were not verified.

      ID Check: The [ID] attribute is not blank and all IDs are unique.

      Coordinate Check: Coordinates are not null or zero and the x and y fields match the shape.

      Basic Address Check: Physical addresses were verified to be non blank and to not be a "PO Box", "General Delivery", "Highway Contract", or "Rural Route" address.

      Highway Address without Type Check: Physical addresses containing the word "Highway" or "Route" were verified to also contain a type designator such as "State", "US", or "County", if one actually exists for the highway or route. These type designators are often missing from addresses, leading to confusion if more than one "Highway" of the given number exists in an area.

      Basic Name Check: Entity name is not blank, is not the same as entity city, and has a minimum of 2 characters. Name does not contain punctuation characters that can interfere with database operations, such as " (quote) and * (asterisk).

      Basic Phone Check: All phone numbers (including the area code) are ten (10) numeric digits. Alphabetic characters have been converted to the corresponding numeric digit.

      County FIPS to State Compare Check: The county represented by the tabular FIPS Code attribute is actually in the state specified by the state attribute.

      County Name to State Compare Check: The county represented by the tabular county name attribute is actually in the state specified by the state attribute.

      Phone Number Format Check: Phone numbers (including area code) were verified to be formatted as nnn-nnn-nnnn.

      NPA_NXX Check: Area codes (sometimes called "Number Planning Areas", or NPA's) and central office codes (sometimes known as exchanges, or NXX's) were validated against data from the North American Number Planning Administration (NANPA). In some cases, NPA-NXX combinations did not show up in the NANPA data but were verified to work.

      Zip Code Check: The zip code is five (5) or nine (9) numeric digits, is listed in the postal database, is in the same state as indicated by the entity's [STATE] attribute, and is not a PO Box only zip code.

      Zip City Check: The entity's zip code and its city were verified to match according to the USPS Address Information System (AIS).

      NAICS Code Check: Verifies the NAICS field is not blank, the NAICS Code is one of the accepted codes for this layer, and that certain key words in the entity name do not conflict with the NAICS Code.

      Collocation Check: Entities with different addresses must not share the exact same geospatial location.

      Geographic Spell Check: Words that appear in the entity name were checked against a standard English word list (and Spanish word list for entities in Puerto Rico). Words not appearing in these standard word lists were then checked against names appearing in the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) of geographic features that are located within 25 miles of the entity. Proper names were manually reviewed for correct spelling.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: See "Attribute_Accuracy_Report". Many of the checks described in that section check for both attribute accuracy and logical consistency.
  Completeness_Report:
    This dataset consists of Colleges and Universities in North Carolina.

    Secondary education facilities, Administrative offices, or Post Secondary Education facilities that are non degree granting schools are intended to be excluded from this dataset, but a few may be included.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: The geographic location of contacted entities was verified to be correct relative to the street data and version indicated by the [ST_VENDOR] and [ST_VERSION] attributes. The horizontal accuracy is indicated by the [GEOPREC] attribute.  A value of "BLOCKFACE" indicates the entity was geocoded on the correct block and correct side of the street.  A value of "ONENTITY" indicates that the location is on the entity's facility as determined by USGS DOQQ imagery and that it is on the correct block and correct side of the street.

    Attribute:
      Attribute_Label: CITY
      Attribute_Definition:
        The name of the city associated with the entity's physical address. For physical addresses that the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) delivers to, this should be a "city" acceptable to the USPS as defined in their Address Information System (AIS). Sometimes the USPS does not deliver mail to a physical address but recognizes the location (i.e., they list the location as "undeliverable"). The cities associated with these locations are acceptable. In some cases, the USPS does not recognize individual physical addresses in a city, rather, they list the city as having "General Delivery". In these cases, the city and associated zip code are acceptable (the entity's [ADDRESS] attribute will contain a street address, not "general delivery"). The entity may not actually be located within the city limits of the "city" specified in its city field. Instead, it may actually be located within the city limits of another city. In some cases, the "city" that appears in this attribute may not even be a city in an administrative sense, but it is still an acceptable "city" to the USPS. An example of this is "Notre Dame, IN". There is no city in Indiana called "Notre Dame", but this is considered an acceptable city by the USPS for any delivery going to the University of Notre Dame which is actually located in the city of South Bend. "Notre Dame", like most USPS cities, is an easily recognized place, and it gives the user of the data a good general idea of where the entity is located (if the entity is located in a small municipality, the USPS "city" may be more recognizable than the name of the municipality), and it would be part of the address one would use to send a shipment to the entity's location. Using the USPS acceptable "city" also allows someone to do a logical consistency check between the zip code and the city by using the USPS AIS.

        Sometimes an entity may report a city that is not accepted by the USPS, and although TGS has tried to replace those cities with an acceptable alternative, some of them may remain in this dataset.

      Attribute_Label: STATE
      Attribute_Definition: Two (2) character abbreviation for state associated with the entity's physical address. In almost all cases this is the same as the state where the entity has been depicted geospatially. However, there are cases, particularly where an entity is part of a larger facility that cuts across state lines, where the entity's location may be depicted in a state other than the one indicated in this attribute. Also, the state in which an entity appears to be located may change depending on the scale of the state boundary theme being used.

      Attribute_Label: NAICSDESCR
      Attribute_Definition:
        NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) Description for entity. The "Index Entries" that appear on the NAICS webpage (http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html) are being used to populate this attribute as opposed to the "NAICS Title". While there is a one to one correspondence between NAICS Codes and "NAICS Titles", there is a one to many relationship between NAICS Codes and the "Index Entries". By using the "Index Entries", we have placed the entities that make up this layer into more specific categories; however, the user of this data should be aware that this was not the intended purpose of these "Index Entries". The "Index Entries" were intended as a way to search the NAICS database and as a way of enumerating ways in which establishments falling under the given NAICS Code may be named. Thus, there are often two or more "Index Entries" that are synonyms, for example: "Prisons" and "Penitentiaries". In cases like this, we have standardized on one "Index Entry".

        NAICS Descriptions (and NAICS Codes) have been assigned based upon the entity's primary function, regardless of the function that qualified it to be included in this dataset.
