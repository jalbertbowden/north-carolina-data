  Description:
    Abstract:
      Jails and Prisons (Correctional Institutions).

      The Jails and Prisons sub-layer is part of the Emergency Law Enforcement Sector and the Critical Infrastructure Category. A Jail or Prison consists of any facility or location where individuals are regularly and lawfully detained against their will. This includes Federal and State prisons, local jails, and juvenile detention facilities, as well as law enforcement temporary holding facilities. Work camps, including camps operated seasonally, are included if they otherwise meet the definition. A Federal Prison is a facility operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons for the incarceration of individuals. A State Prison is a facility operated by a state, commonwealth, or territory of the US for the incarceration of individuals for a term usually longer than 1 year. A Juvenile Detention Facility is a facility for the incarceration of those who have not yet reached the age of majority (usually 18 years). A Local Jail is a locally administered facility that holds inmates beyond arraignment (usually 72 hours) and is staffed by municipal or county employees. A temporary holding facility, sometimes referred to as a "police lock up" or "drunk tank", is a facility used to detain people prior to arraignment. Locations that are administrative offices only are excluded from the dataset. This definition of Jails is consistent with that used by the Department of Justice (DOJ) in their "National Jail Census", with the exception of "temporary holding facilities", which the DOJ excludes.

      Locations which function primarily as law enforcement offices are included in this dataset if they have holding cells.

      If the facility is enclosed with a fence, wall, or structure with a gate around the buildings only, the locations were depicted as "on entity" at the center of the facility. If the facility's buildings are not enclosed, the locations were depicted as "on entity" on the main building or "block face" on the correct street segment.

      Personal homes, administrative offices, and temporary locations are intended to be excluded from this dataset; however, some personal homes of constables are included due to the fact that many constables work out of their homes.

      TGS has made a concerted effort to include all correctional institutions.

      This dataset includes non license restricted data from the following federal agencies: Bureau of Indian Affairs; Bureau of Reclamation; U.S. Park Police; Federal Bureau of Prisons; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; U.S. Marshals Service; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; National Park Service; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

      This dataset is comprised completely of license free data.

      The Law Enforcement dataset and the Correctional Institutions dataset were merged into one working file. TGS processed as one file and then separated for delivery purposes.

      With the merge of the Law Enforcement and the Correctional Institutions datasets, NAICS Codes & Descriptions were assigned based on the facility's main function which was determined by the entity's name, facility type, web research, and state supplied data. In instances where the entity's primary function is both law enforcement and corrections, the NAICS Codes and Descriptions are assigned based on the dataset in which the record is located (i.e., a facility that serves as both a Sheriff's Office and as a jail is designated as [NAICSDESCR]="SHERIFFS' OFFICES (EXCEPT COURT FUNCTIONS ONLY)" in the Law Enforcement layer and as [NAICSDESCR]="JAILS (EXCEPT PRIVATE OPERATION OF)" in the Correctional Institutions layer).

      Records with "-DOD" appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries.

      "#" and "*" characters were automatically removed from standard fields that TGS populated. Double spaces were replaced by single spaces in these same fields.

      Text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results.

      All diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics.

      The currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] field. Based on the values in this field, the oldest record dates from 12/07/2004 and the newest record dates from 10/22/2009
    Purpose:
      Homeland Security

      Use Cases: Use cases describe how the data may be used and help to define and clarify requirements.

      1. A threat to cause the mass release of prisoners by an outside terrorist group has been identified. Steps need to be taken to provide extra security at the targeted prisons.

      2. Massive civil unrest has resulted in a large number of arrests. Appropriate space is needed outside of the immediate area to house the arrested individuals.

      3. Massive civil unrest has resulted in a large number of arrests. A "holding camp" has been established to hold those arrested. Trained security guards are needed to staff the holding camp.

      4. A disaster has caused the need for an emergency labor force (e.g., sandbagging during a flood) and prisoners may fill that need.

      5. Inmates may need to be evacuated, or appropriate steps may need to be taken at a prison to protect the inmates and to ensure that a disaster does not present an opportunity for escape.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      For entities that were contacted, the name, address, city, state, and five (5) digit zip codes were verified to be correct as of the date indicated by the [CONTDATE] field. The existence of the entity was also verified, as well as whether or not it met the criteria for inclusion in this dataset. Four (4) digit zip code extensions were derived from USPS (United States Postal Service) data and were not verified.

      ID Check: The [ID] field is not blank and each of its values is unique.

      Coordinate Check: Coordinates are not null or zero and the [X] and [Y] fields match the shape.

      Basic Address Check: Physical addresses were verified to be non blank and to not be a "PO Box", "General Delivery", "Highway Contract", or "Rural Route" address.

      Highway Address without Type Check: Physical addresses containing the word "Highway" or "Route" were verified to also contain a type designator such as "State", "US", or "County", if one actually exists for the highway or route. These type designators are often missing from addresses, leading to confusion if more than one "Highway" of the given number exists in an area.

      Basic Name Check: Entity name is not blank, is not the same as entity city, and has a minimum of two (2) characters. Name does not contain punctuation characters that can interfere with database operations, such as " (quote) and * (asterisk).

      City Check: Entity's [CITY] field is not blank, and entity is located within 25 miles of its tabular city as found in the NAVTEQ Named Places reference file.

      State Check: The entity is located within its tabular state.

      County Check: The entity is located within its tabular county.

      FIPS Check: The tabular FIPS Code matches the entity's tabular county and tabular state.

      County in Name vs. Geographic Location Check: If an entity's [NAME] field contains the word "county" or "co", the same county value should also be in the entity's [COUNTY] field.

      Basic Phone Check: All phone numbers (including the area code) are ten (10) numeric digits. Alphabetic characters have been converted to the corresponding numeric digit.

      NPA_NXX Check: Area codes (sometimes called "Number Planning Areas", or NPA's) and central office codes (sometimes known as exchanges, or NXX's) were validated against data from the North American Number Planning Administration (NANPA). In some cases, NPA-NXX combinations did not show up in the NANPA data but were verified to work.

      Area Code Distance Check: The entity's area code (NPA) is valid, and the entity is not more than 25 miles from its area code boundary, as defined by data from the North American Number Planning Administration (NANPA), unless TGS has previously verified that the phone number rings to a headquarters location or otherwise does not ring to the entity's location.

      Zip Code Check: The entity's zip code is five (5) or nine (9) numeric digits, is listed in the postal database, is in the same state as indicated by the entity's [STATE] value, and is not a PO Box only zip code.

      Zip City Check: The entity's zip code and its city were verified to match according to the USPS Address Information System (AIS).

      Zip Code Distance Check: The entity is located within 25 miles of its zip code boundary, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau's 1999 Zip Code file.

      NAICS Code Check: The NAICS field is not blank, the NAICS Code is one of the accepted codes for this layer, the NAICS Description is an acceptable Index Entry for the NAICS Code, and certain key words in the entity name do not conflict with the NAICS Code.

      Collocation Check: Entities with different addresses must not share the exact same geospatial location.

      Geographic Spell Check: Words that appear in the entity name were checked against a standard English word list (and Spanish word list for entities in Puerto Rico). Words not appearing in these standard word lists were then checked against names appearing in the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) of geographic features that are located within 25 miles of the entity. Proper names were manually reviewed for correct spelling.

      Supplied Coordinates Distance Check: Entity is located within 3 miles of coordinates supplied by the original source.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: See "Attribute_Accuracy_Report". Many of the checks described in that section check for both attribute accuracy and logical consistency.
  Completeness_Report:
    TGS has made a concerted effort to include all correctional institutions in North Carolina.

    Locations which function primarily as law enforcement offices are included in this dataset if they have holding cells.

    Personal homes, administrative offices, and temporary locations are intended to be excluded from this dataset; however, some personal homes of constables are included due to the fact that many constables work out of their homes.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The geographic location of entities was verified to be correct relative to the street vendor and version indicated by the [ST_VENDOR] and [ST_VERSION] fields. The horizontal accuracy is indicated by the [GEOPREC] field. A value of "BLOCKFACE" indicates the entity was geocoded on the correct street segment (block) and correct side of the street. A value of "ONENTITY" indicates that the location is on the entity's facility, as determined by USGS DOQQ imagery, and that it is on the correct street segment (block) and correct side of the street. Entities that are part of a larger institution (e.g., University Campus or Military Base) with "BLOCKFACE" precision may be located at the main entrance to the larger institution.

        Records with "-DOD" appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        1) The Correctional Institutions dataset and the Law Enforcement dataset were merged into one working file. TGS processed as one file and then separated for delivery purposes.

        2) Entities were processed to determine or verify their name, physical address, city, state, five (5) digit zip code, phone number, and geospatial location. Entities that were contacted were also asked if they provided law enforcement services, correctional institution services, or both. Entities not located on military bases were contacted and asked to describe their location relative to landmarks in reference data (mainly streets) and features visible in ortho imagery. A phone number was not available for some entities, so their information was verified using other verbal contacts made through a telephone call.

        3) Due to a request made by the Department of Defense, TGS made every effort to not contact military bases starting 03/27/2007 and ending 05/28/2008. During this time, entities located on military bases were verified through alternate resources, such as maps and ortho imagery. These records have not been contacted by TGS, and therefore, do not have directions.

        4) All text fields were set to all upper case.

        5) Leading and trailing spaces were trimmed from all text fields.

        6) Non printable and diacritic characters were removed from all text fields.

Entity_and_Attribute_Information:
  Detailed_Description:
    Entity_Type:
      Entity_Type_Label: Jails and Prisons (Correctional Institutions) in North Carolina
      Entity_Type_Definition: The Jails and Prisons sub-layer is part of the Emergency Law Enforcement Sector and the Critical Infrastructure Category. A Jail or Prison consists of any facility or location where individuals are regularly and lawfully detained against their will. This includes Federal and State prisons, local jails, and juvenile detention facilities, as well as law enforcement temporary holding facilities. Work camps, including camps operated seasonally, are included if they otherwise meet the definition. A Federal Prison is a facility operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons for the incarceration of individuals. A State Prison is a facility operated by a state, commonwealth, or territory of the US for the incarceration of individuals for a term usually longer than 1 year. A Juvenile Detention Facility is a facility for the incarceration of those who have not yet reached the age of majority (usually 18 years). A Local Jail is a locally administered facility that holds inmates beyond arraignment (usually 72 hours) and is staffed by municipal or county employees. A temporary holding facility, sometimes referred to as a "police lock up" or "drunk tank", is a facility used to detain people prior to arraignment. Locations that are administrative offices only are excluded from the dataset. This definition of Jails is consistent with that used by the Department of Justice (DOJ) in their "National Jail Census", with the exception of "temporary holding facilities", which the DOJ excludes.

      Attribute_Domain_Values:
        Unrepresentable_Domain: Text
    Attribute:
      Attribute_Label: CITY
      Attribute_Definition:
        The name of the city associated with the entity's physical address. For physical addresses that the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) delivers to, this should be a "city" acceptable to the USPS as defined in their Address Information System (AIS). Sometimes the USPS does not deliver mail to a physical address but recognizes the location (i.e., they list the location as "undeliverable"). The cities associated with these locations are acceptable. In some cases, the USPS does not recognize individual physical addresses in a city, rather, they list the city as having "General Delivery". In these cases, the city and associated zip code are acceptable (the entity's [ADDRESS] field will contain a street address, not "general delivery"). The entity may not actually be located within the city limits of the "city" specified in its [CITY] field. Instead, it may actually be located within the city limits of another city. In some cases, the "city" that appears in this field may not even be a city in an administrative sense, but it is still an acceptable "city" to the USPS. An example of this is "Notre Dame, IN". There is no city in Indiana called "Notre Dame", but this is considered an acceptable city by the USPS for any delivery going to the University of Notre Dame which is actually located in the city of South Bend. "Notre Dame", like most USPS cities, is an easily recognized place, and it gives the user of the data a good general idea of where the entity is located (if the entity is located in a small municipality, the USPS "city" may be more recognizable than the name of the municipality), and it would be part of the address one would use to send a shipment to the entity's location. Using the USPS acceptable "city" also allows someone to do a logical consistency check between the zip code and the city by using the USPS AIS.

        Sometimes an entity may report a city that is not accepted by the USPS, and although TGS has tried to replace those cities with an acceptable alternative, some of them may remain in this dataset.

      Attribute_Definition: Two (2) character abbreviation for state associated with the entity's physical address. In almost all cases, this is the same as the state where the entity has been depicted geospatially. However, there are cases, particularly where an entity is part of a larger facility that cuts across state lines, where the entity's location may be depicted in a state other than the one indicated in this field. Also, the state in which an entity appears to be located may change depending on the scale of the state boundary theme being used.

      Attribute_Definition: NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) Description for entity. The "Index Entries" that appear on the NAICS webpage (http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html) are being used to populate this attribute as opposed to the "NAICS Title". While there is a one to one correspondence between NAICS Codes and "NAICS Titles", there is a one to many relationship between NAICS Codes and the "Index Entries". By using the "Index Entries", we have placed the entities that make up this layer into more specific categories; however, the user of this data should be aware that this was not the intended purpose of these "Index Entries". The "Index Entries" were intended as a way to search the NAICS database and as a way of enumerating ways in which establishments falling under the given NAICS Code may be named. Thus, there are often two or more "Index Entries" that are synonyms, for example: "Prisons" and "Penitentiaries". In cases like this, we have standardized on one "Index Entry".  NAICS Descriptions (and NAICS Codes) have been assigned based upon the entity's primary function, regardless of the function that qualified it to be included in this dataset.
