## Population
#### Field Name: population
#### Short Field Name: p1
### Description 
Total Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA) population.
### Importance 
Total population is a baseline measure that indicates the number of people living in an NPA.   It is used to calculate density, and other per capita data.Trends in population show where the community is growing and where it is decreasing, which can help the City, County and Towns as well as other services providers know where infrastructure and other services may be needed.The 2010 Census reported 308.7 million people in the United States, a 9.7 percent increase from the Census 2000 population of 281.4 million.
### Source 
U.S. Census, 2010
### Technical Notes 
Provides the population based on the 2010 Census for each NPA using Block Group geography. Census block groups are the second smallest unit of measure used in the decennial Census. Only the census block is smaller. A block group is a cluster of census blocks within the same census tract. The average block group contains 39 blocks comprising between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people.

### Source 
Mecklenburg County Tax Parcels as of April 2012.
### Technical Notes 
The total assessed value for residential housing units in 2011 minus the total assessed value for residential housing units in 2003 divided by the total assessed value for residential housing units in 2003 for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA). NPAs with less than 5 qualifying properties were classified as N/A. Residential housing units include condominiums, single-family detached units and townhouses. Pearson's Appraisal Service identified that some neighborhoods needed to be reassessed. Based on these findings, the County will reassess the value of property in complex areas, particularly pre-1980 heterogeneous neighborhoods, to ensure equity which may change the values represented in this variable.

## Residential Foreclosures
#### Field Name: foreclosures
#### Short Field Name: g9
### Description 
Percentage of residential foreclosures for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).
### Importance 
The foreclosure crisis can have debilitating effects on neighborhoods.  Concentrations of foreclosed homes in an area negatively affect property values and public services. Foreclosures can be found in all neighborhoods; however, the impacts are more problematic in certain locations and within certain housing markets. There are 3,520 foreclosures represented on this map or 1.2% of single-family (attached and detached) housing units.
### Source 
Mecklenburg County Register of Deeds from fiscal year July 2010 to June 2011.
### Technical Notes 
The number of foreclosures for single-family dwellings, condominiums and townhouses in each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA) identified by the Sales Code of FC in Sale History divided by the number of residential units in each NPA.

## Vacancy Rate
#### Field Name: residential_vacant_rate
#### Short Field Name: g10
### Description 
The rate of vacancies of all residential dwelling units for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).
### Importance 
Vacant units are an occurrence in all areas.  Long standing and concentrated amounts of vacant properties could indicate financial stress on the owner, less than standard housing conditions, housing design or an oversupply of housing.
### Source 
U.S. Census, 2010

## Single-Family Rental Houses (Detached)
#### Field Name: rental_units
#### Short Field Name: g11
### Description 
Percentage of detached single-family rental dwellings for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).
### Importance 
Rental housing is a desirable option for many residents, particularly in the current economic climate. There is no reliable data regarding the effect of rented homes on neighborhood property value.  Increasing numbers of rented properties should be analyzed with other data such as the age and condition of the homes, design, or house size, adjacent land uses, and area incomes. A major factor to consider with rented homes is the level of management by the owners which impacts adjacent properties positively or negatively as much as owner-occupied dwellings.
### Source 
Mecklenburg County Tax Parcels, 2011
### Technical Notes 
The number of single-family (detached) rental housing summed for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA) and divided by the NPA total number of single-family (detached housing).

## Subsidized Housing Units
#### Field Name: subsidized_housing
#### Short Field Name: g12
### Description 
Percentage of all subsidized housing units for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).
### Importance 
Identifying the location of subsidized units allows housing providers to develop implementation plans and residents to understand the types of housing choices that are present in their community. Concentrating assisted-housing for low and very low-income Americans in dense, urban areas is not an effective use of scarce affordable housing resources (USHUD). Mixed-income development has become a popular housing solution by creating diverse communities and decentralizing poverty.
### Source 
Charlotte-Housing Authority, Housing and Urban Development, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Housing Partnership, Habitat for Humanity, 2010.
### Technical Notes 
The number of subsidized housing for each neighborhood Profile Area (NPA) divided by the total number of housing units for each NPA. Subsidized housing includes single-family, condominiums and townhouses and multi-family housing. Although most subsidized housing units are multi‚Äêfamily, the data and information available to distinguish between the two housing types is not reliable. The definition of subsidized housing varies depending on the municipality.

## Residential Electricity Consumption
#### Field Name: energy_consumption
#### Short Field Name: w17
### Description 
Average household monthly electricity consumption in kilowatts per Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).
### Importance 
Provides baseline information to determine the average electricity use for households within the NPA.  Data can been used to target educational programs, weatherization services, grant funds or other initiatives to reduce energy use in areas that exhibit higher usage.  Reducing electricity use saves money and lowers the demand for additional power plants to be constructed which may lead to increased air pollution and degradation of resources.
### Source 
Duke Energy
### Technical Notes 
Data was received at the block group level and aggregated to the NPA geography. Data represents the average monthly energy use in kilowatt hours for the 12-month period beginning July 1, 2010 and ending June 30, 2011. Data is not included for cases where the block group contains fewer than five (5) residential customers. Data is not included for the towns as information is not finalized.
