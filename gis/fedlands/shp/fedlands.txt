  Description:
    Abstract: This dataset represents land owned by the federal government in North Carolina. This is a subset of the North Carolina Natural Heritage Program's Managed Areas.  The Managed Areas shapefile is primarily a collection of fee simple properties and easements where conservation is one of the management goals. It does include a number of properties and easements that are not primarily managed for conservation, but that are of conservation interest. This conservation interest ranges from properties and easements which support rare species and intact, high-quality natural communities to those that are open spaces in places where open space is scarce. The property and easement boundaries in this shapefile were acquired from a wide variety of sources, and in some cases their boundaries are approximate. Because of these inaccuracies, this shapefile is intended to be used as an aid to conservation planning only and not as a substitute for land survey data. Inclusion of an area in this shapefile in no way implies that the area is open to the public.
    Purpose: This dataset is intended as a resource for conservation planning purposes.  The collection includes lands in conservation status as well as large publicly owned properties. The dataset is not a substitute for land survey data.
    Supplemental_Information: The completeness and consistency of the federal subset of Managed Areas was verified in 2012 by the Federal Interagency Committee under the NC Geographic Information Coordinating Council.  The committee assembled federal land ownership data from various federal agencies and compared the results to Managed Areas and the related federal Protected Areas Database.  The committee found only minor differences in geometry and properties.  Given the business need for the Natural Heritage Program to compile Managed Areas, including federal land, the committee concluded that the most efficient and effective method for maintaining a geospatial dataset for federal land in North Carolina is to derive a subset of federal lands from Managed Areas when the Natural Heritage Program publishes updates to Managed Areas.  This compilation of federal lands does not include small properties relating to federal office buildings or facilities of the US Postal Service; and this selection does not include easements managed by federal programs on non-federal property. Also, this dataset is the current equivalent of "Federal Land Ownership" in North Carolina (published in 2006).

Data_Quality_Information:
  Logical_Consistency_Report: Managed areas are consistently represented as polygons that approximate property boundaries.  Nonetheless, inclusion in this dataset is arbitrary and in no way implies that included areas are protected or accessible to the public.  In some instances, boundaries of adjacent properties provided by different sources may be inconsistent, creating minor overlaps or gaps in managed areas of conservation interest.  Given the tendency to publish quarterly, the discrepancies are not resolved each time a source dataset is integrated in the compilation.
  Completeness_Report: The dataset is complete based on the best available source datasets and representations of managed areas.  The source data may change frequently.  Users should contact the North Carolina Natural Heritage Program (Division of Natural Resources Planning and Conservation, Department of Environment and Natural Resources, MSC 1601, Raleigh, NC 27699-1601) before use of the data set to ensure data currency.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Obtained source data from a variety of sources. Boundaries of federal lands, such as national parks and forest, wildlife refuges, and military bases, were primarily obtained from federal agencies; when primary sources were not available, county cadastral data were used instead.  State agencies provided boundaries for state parks & natural areas, state forests, game lands, coastal reserves, plant conservation preserves, and other state-owned lands & easements.  Boundaries of local parks and easements were provided by local governments or were copied from county cadastral data.  Boundaries of private nature preserves and easements were obtained from private land trusts and conservation organizations. The original compilation included boundaries digitized from lines drawn on paper USGS topographic maps.  These have largely been replaced with better data, as updates tend to be digital in origin in recent years.  Initially attempts were made to resolve boundary discrepancies, but this is no longer done, and as a result minor overlaps or gaps often occur between adjacent properties.  Processing includes integration of all polygons and attribution of each polygon.  Quality control includes checks for attribute consistency to enable efficient querying and symbolization. The Federal Lands subset (lands under federal ownership) was derived by selecting all records where OWNER_TYPE = "Federal" AND CATEGORY = "Fee" and exporting that selection to a new feature class. This selection does not include easements on non-federal property.
