  Description:
    Abstract:
      The North Carolina Department of Environment, Health, and
      Natural Resources, Division of Land Resources, NC Geological
      Survey, in cooperation with the North Carolina Center for
      Geographic Information and Analysis, developed the GIS data set
      version of the Geology of North Carolina.  The data represents
      the digital equivalent of the official State Geology map (1:500,000-scale),
      but was digitized from (1:250,000-scale) base maps.  This file
      contains the line attributes which identify faults in North Carolina.
      The geologic formation id is the only attribute present.  There
      are two additional files which accompany this layer, formations and dikes.
      These should be used together with the faults layer. All three files come
      together. (Refer to the cross references section for more detail on
      the formations and dikes).
    Purpose:
      This data was created to assist governmental agencies and
      others in making resource management decisions through use of
      a Geographic Information System (GIS).
    Supplemental_Information:
      This data includes three coverages: geol250, which contains
      geologic formations; geol250d, which contains dikes; and
      geol250f, which contains faults.

      NC State Geologic Map, shown at a 1:500,000 scale), contact:

      This coverage corresponds to the DOT county boundary file.
      Other county boundary files may not be compatible with this
      layer.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      NCCGIA digitized the geology features and faults
      from mylar stable bases identifying boundary and name attributes of
      geologic features.  A review by check plot overlay was used to determine
      label discrepancies and found discrepancies were corrected.
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Using ESRI's ARC/INFO GIS software, the
    dataset was built for arc topology using the "build" command.
    The data set was then cleaned with a fuzzy tolerance of 1 foot.  Topology
    has not been edited since the last build or clean.
  Completeness_Report:
    These data represent faults found on the official geologic map
    of North Carolina.  The information consists of three coverages, which
    depict the state's geologic formations, its faults, and its dikes. Only
    geology formation names are attributed.

    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        No official accuracy assessment has be performed on this data
        set. The digital files were checked to within a linewidth of
        the original base maps.  The base maps were delineated with
        geologic extents identified by the U.S. Geological Survey and
        the NC Geologic Survey.
