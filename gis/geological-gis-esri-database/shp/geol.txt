  Description:
    Abstract:
      The North Carolina Department of Environment and
      Natural Resources, Division of Land Resources, NC Geological
      Survey, in cooperation with the North Carolina Center for
      Geographic Information and Analysis, developed the GIS data set
      version of the Geology of North Carolina.  The data represents
      the digital equivalent of the official State Geology map (1:500,000-
      scale), but was digitized from (1:250,000-scale) base maps.
      There are two additional data sets which accompany this layer, dikes and
      structures. These should be used together with the Geology formations
      layer. All three data sets come together. (Refer to the cross
      references section for more detail on the dikes and structures).
    Purpose:
      This data was created to assist governmental agencies and
      others in making resource management decisions through use of
      a Geographic Information System (GIS).
    Supplemental_Information:
      These data includes three Feature Classes: geol250_polygons, which contains
      geologic formations; geol250_dikes, which contains diabase dikes; and
      geol250_structuress, which contains geologic structures (faults, folds, scarps,
      contacts, and structural symbols).

      To purchase a hardcopy of this data layer (the official 1985
      NC State Geologic Map, shown at a 1:500,000 scale), contact:
      NC Geologic Survey
      Mail Service Center 1612
      Raleigh, NC 27699-1612
      (919) 733-2423
      Hard copy plots (1:500,000) from the digital files are available for $12.00.
      The published, printed map is out-of-print and no longer available.
      Call to confirm availability and price.

      These data correspond  to the DOT county boundary file.
      Other county boundary files may not be compatible with this
      layer.

      Use the ESRI layer file = geol250_polygons_92.lyr for proper symbolization as depicted on the published 1985 map; link to field 'GEOCODE'.  This layer file was created using ArcGIS 9.2.  If this file does not accompany this dataset, contact the NC Geological Survey for a copy.

      Revisions and updates to this layer include:
      5.) October 2007 = Updated minor coding errors in polygon attribute table. Layer file created for symbology to match
      as closely as possible the published  1985 printed Geologic Map of North Carolina.
      4.) September 2007 = conversion from ESRI Arc/Info Coverage to ESRI Personal Geodatabase.
      this was done in an effort to capture and store all pertinent data in this dataset.
      3.) filename: geol250ed  The July 1999 update to this layer fixed digitization
      errors in the 1998 and 1993 revisions. The July 1999 update includes additional
      attributes and an five auxiliary text files which include information from the
      hard copy 1985 Geologic Map.
      2.) filename: geol2501298  The December 1998 update to this layer consisted of
      projecting the data from NAD27 datum, State Plane projection, units of measure
      feet TO: NAD83 DATUM, State Plane PROJECTION, UNITS OF MEASURE METERS.  This was
      done to comply with the NC Geographic Information Coordinating Council's
      "Statement of Direction for North Carolina Corporate Geographic Database
      Horizontal Reference, Datum and Unit of Measure".  This reprojecting was done in
      various ways depending on the data type and content.  Vector data was projected
      using the 'project' command in ESRI's Arc software and topology was cleaned and
      built based on coverage needs.  Raster data was projected using ESRI's Grid module
      and various steps as applicable.
      1.)geol25093 - This represents the 1993 version which contains
      the following correction. In the spring of 1993, a geologic
      formation (ZYba, Amphibolite) in Macon County was added in order
      to correct the digital file. This formation had been omitted in
      the original digitization. The file containing the omitted
      information has been deleted.  The associated files names are:
      geol250d for dikes and geol250f for faults.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      NCCGIA digitized the geology features
      from mylar stable bases identifying boundary and name attributes of
      geologic features.  A review by check plot overlay was used to determine
      label discrepancies and found discrepancies were corrected.
      NCGS entered attribute information into a database and checked the printed
      database against the paper 1985 Geologic Map.
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Using ESRI's ARC/INFO GIS software, the
    dataset was built for arc and polygon topology using the "build" command.
    The data set was then cleaned with a fuzzy tolerance of 1 meter.  Topology
    has not been edited since the last build or clean.
  Completeness_Report:
    These data represent the official geologic map
    of North Carolina.  The information consists of three coverages and five text files
    of attributes, which depict the state's geologic formations, its structures,
    and its dikes.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        No official accuracy assessment has be performed on this data
        set. The digital files were checked to within a linewidth of
        the original base maps.  The base maps were delineated with
        geologic extents identified by the U.S. Geological Survey and
        the NC Geologic Survey.
