Included is an ArcGIS Layer file for ArcGIS versions 9.2 and above; the polygon symbology that mimics the symbology presenton the published Geologic Map of North Carolina, 1985. The filename is geol_92.lyr.

Finally, an age_ref.dbf table is included that contains map references for the age determinations for selected geologic units.  This table could not bedirectly related to the polygon feature class, however, it holds value for a researcher.
