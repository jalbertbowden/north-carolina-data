    Abstract:
      Hurricane Evacuation Routes in North Carolina

      A hurricane evacuation route is a designated route used to direct traffic inland in case of a hurricane threat.

      This dataset is based on supplied data from gulf coast and Atlantic seaboard states.  Each state was contacted by TGS to determine an official source for hurricane evacuation routes.  GIS data was gathered from states willing to share such data.  In cases where states were unable or unwilling to share data in this format, TGS requested that the states provide a source for identifying hurricane evacuation routes. The states usually identified a website that made this data available to the public.

      Hurricane evacuation routes depicted on non-GIS maps were digitized using aerial ortho imagery while referencing supplied maps and NAVTEQ_Streets_2006_Q3.

      Shape files that depicted hurricane evacuation routes were edge matched and merged with the digitized evacuation routes.

      All routes identified as primary hurricane evacuation routes were included in this dataset.  If a state also designated secondary hurricane evacuation routes, they were included as well.  Routes depicted in this dataset are dependent upon what each state identified as a hurricane evacuation route.  Criteria used to identify these routes may vary from state to state.
    Purpose:
      Homeland Security

      Use Cases: Use cases describe how the data may be used and help to define and clarify requirements.

      1) A resource for emergency route planning purposes.

      2) A resource for situational awareness planning and response for federal government events.

      3) A portion of an evacuation route may be rendered unusable due to natural or man made disaster and rerouting of traffic is necessary.

      4) An incident has occurred during an evacuation and first responders must quickly deploy to the area.

      5) Public awareness.

      ID Check: The [ID] attribute is not blank and all IDs are unique.

      Connectivity Check: Ensured connectivity of digitized evacuation routes with state supplied evacuation routes that cross state lines. Eliminated or connected all orphaned segments.

      Geometry Check: Ensures that all geometry is valid, such as: short segment, null geometry, incorrect segment orientation, and self intersections.

      Repair Geometry Check:  Repairs any invalid geometry found in the Geometry Check.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: See the "Attribute_Accuracy_Report" section. The checks described in that section check for both attribute accuracy and logical consistency.
  Completeness_Report:
    This dataset is based on information provided by the North Carolina Center for Geographic Information and Analysis.

    All routes identified as primary evacuation routes are included in this dataset.  If a state also designated secondary evacuation routes, they are included as well.  Routes depicted in this dataset are dependent upon what each state identified as an evacuation route.  Criteria used to identify these routes may vary from state to state.

      Process_Description:
        Hurricane Evacuation Routes Processing

        1) Each state was contacted by TGS to determine an official source for hurricane evacuation routes.  GIS data was gathered from states willing to share such data.  In cases where states were unable or unwilling to share data in this format, TGS requested that the states provide a source for identifying hurricane evacuation routes. The states usually identified a website that made this data available to the public.
        >
        1a) In some cases, the shape files provided by the states were determined to be unsuitable for inclusion in the completed dataset.  In these cases, public maps from the state websites were substituted and processed as described below.
        >
        2) Hurricane evacuation routes depicted on non-GIS maps were digitized using aerial ortho imagery while referencing supplied maps and NAVTEQ_Streets_2006_Q3.
        >
        3) A state supplied shape (.shp) file from NC was used as received. All attribution was provided by the state and TGS did not verify these values.
        >
        4) TGS ensured connectivity by edge matching digitized evacuation routes and state supplied evacuation routes across state lines. TGS also eliminated or connected all orphaned segments.
        >
        5) Whenever possible, TGS attempted to attribute basic fields within state supplied data.
        >
        6) A seamless data layer was created by merging all shape files and by creating a standardized table structure.
        >
        7) The hurricane evacuation routes were reviewed by TGS' internal Quality Assurance. In addition to individual review, the dataset was examined in aggregate using the tests described under "Attribute_Accuracy_Report".
        >
        8) All text fields were set to all upper case.
        >
        9) Leading and trailing spaces were trimmed from all text fields.
        >
        10) Non printable and diacritic characters were removed from all text fields.
