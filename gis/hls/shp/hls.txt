    Abstract:
      Hospitals in North Carolina

      The term "hospital" ... means an institution which-

      (1) is primarily engaged in providing, by or under the supervision of physicians, to inpatients

      >	(A) diagnostic services and therapeutic services for medical diagnosis, treatment, and care of injured, disabled, or sick persons, or
      >	(B) rehabilitation services for the rehabilitation of injured, disabled, or sick persons;

      (...)

      (5) provides 24-hour nursing service rendered or supervised by a registered professional nurse, and has a licensed practical nurse or registered professional nurse on duty at all times; ...

      (...)

      (7) in the case of an institution in any State in which State or applicable local law provides for the licensing of hospitals,

      >	(A) is licensed pursuant to such law or
      >	(B) is approved, by the agency of such State or locality responsible for licensing hospitals, as meeting the standards established for such licensing;

      (Excerpt from Title XVIII of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. § 1395x(e)], <http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode42/usc_sec_42_00001395---x000-.html>)

      Included in this dataset are General Medical and Surgical Hospitals, Psychiatric and Substance Abuse Hospitals, and Specialty Hospitals (e.g., Children's Hospitals, Cancer Hospitals, Maternity Hospitals, Rehabilitation Hospitals, etc.).

      TGS has made a concerted effort to include all general medical/surgical hospitals in North Carolina. Other types of hospitals are included if they were represented in datasets sent by the state. Therefore, not all of the specialty hospitals in North Carolina are represented in this dataset.

      Hospitals operated by the Veterans Administration (VA) are included, even if the state they are located in does not license VA Hospitals.

      Nursing homes and Urgent Care facilities are excluded because they are included in a separate dataset. Locations that are administrative offices only are excluded from the dataset.

      Records with "-DOD" appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries.

      Text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results.

      All diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics.

      The currentness of this dataset is indicated by the [CONTDATE] field. Based upon this field, the oldest record dates from 12/28/2005 and the newest record dates from 05/09/2008
    Purpose:
      Homeland Security

      Use Cases: Use cases describe how the data may be used and help to define and clarify requirements.

      1) A disaster has overwhelmed local medical facilities and capacity must be found in the surrounding area.

      2) A threat against hospitals has been identified and measures must be taken to protect the hospital.

      3) An assessment as to the adequacy of the total capacity to handle emergency medical care in a given area needs to be made as part of a disaster mitigation plan.

      4) A disaster has occurred, or is in the process of occurring, and facilities in the vicinity with people needing evacuation assistance must be identified.

  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      For entities that were contacted, the name, address, city, state, and five (5) digit zip codes were verified to be correct as of the date indicated by the [CONTDATE] field. The existence of the entity was also verified, as well as whether or not it met the criteria for inclusion in this dataset. Four (4) digit zip code extensions were derived from USPS (United States Postal Service) data and were not verified.

      ID Check: The [ID] field is not blank and each of its values is unique.

      Coordinate Check: Coordinates are not null or zero and the x and y fields match the shape.

      Basic Address Check: Physical addresses were verified to be non blank and to not be a "PO Box", "General Delivery", "Highway Contract", or "Rural Route" address.

      Highway Address without Type Check: Physical addresses containing the word "Highway" or "Route" were verified to also contain a type designator such as "State", "US", or "County", if one actually exists for the highway or route. These type designators are often missing from addresses, leading to confusion if more than one "Highway" of the given number exists in an area.

      Basic Name Check: Entity name is not blank, is not the same as entity city, and has a minimum of 2 characters. Name does not contain punctuation characters that can interfere with database operations, such as " (quote) and * (asterisk).

      City Check: Entity's [CITY] field is not blank, and entity is located within 25 miles of its tabular city as found in the NAVTEQ Named Places reference file.

      State Check: The entity is located within its tabular state.

      County FIPS to State Compare Check: The county represented by the tabular FIPS Code is actually in the state specified in the [STATE] field.

      County Name to State Compare Check: The county represented by the tabular county name is actually in the state specified in the [STATE] field.

      Basic Phone Check: All phone numbers (including the area code) are ten (10) numeric digits. Alphabetic characters have been converted to the corresponding numeric digit.

      NPA_NXX Check: Area codes (sometimes called "Number Planning Areas", or NPA's) and central office codes (sometimes known as exchanges, or NXX's) were validated against data from the North American Number Planning Administration (NANPA). In some cases, NPA-NXX combinations did not show up in the NANPA data but were verified to work.

      Area Code Distance Check: The entity's area code (NPA) is valid, and the entity is not more than 25 miles from its area code boundary, as defined by data from the North American Number Planning Administration (NANPA), unless TGS has previously verified that the phone number rings to a headquarters location or otherwise does not ring to the entity's location.

      Zip Code Check: The zip code is five (5) or nine (9) numeric digits, is listed in the postal database, is in the same state as indicated by the entity's [STATE] value, and is not a PO Box only zip code.

      Zip City Check: The entity's zip code and its city were verified to match according to the USPS Address Information System (AIS).

      Zip Code Distance Check: The entity is located within 25 miles of its zip code boundary, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau's 1999 Zip Code file.

      NAICS Code Check: The NAICS field is not blank, the NAICS Code is one of the accepted codes for this layer, the NAICS Description is an acceptable Index Entry for the NAICS Code, and certain key words in the entity name do not conflict with the NAICS Code.

      Collocation Check: Entities with different addresses must not share the exact same geospatial location.

      Geographic Spell Check: Words that appear in the entity name were checked against a standard English word list (and Spanish word list for entities in Puerto Rico). Words not appearing in these standard word lists were then checked against names appearing in the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) of geographic features that are located within 25 miles of the entity. Proper names were manually reviewed for correct spelling.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: See "Attribute_Accuracy_Report". Many of the checks described in that section check for both attribute accuracy and logical consistency.
  Completeness_Report:
    Included in this dataset are General Medical and Surgical Hospitals, Psychiatric and Substance Abuse Hospitals, and Specialty Hospitals (e.g., Children's Hospitals, Cancer Hospitals, Maternity Hospitals, Rehabilitation Hospitals, etc.).

    TGS has made a concerted effort to include all general medical/surgical hospitals in North Carolina. Other types of hospitals are included if they were represented in datasets sent by the state. Therefore, not all of the specialty hospitals in North Carolina are represented in this dataset.

    Hospitals operated by the Veterans Administration (VA) are included, even if the state they are located in does not license VA Hospitals.

    Nursing homes and Urgent Care facilities are excluded because they are included in a separate dataset. Locations that are administrative offices only are excluded from the dataset.

    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The geographic location of entities was verified to be correct relative to the street data and version indicated by the [ST_VENDOR] and [ST_VERSION] fields. The horizontal accuracy is indicated by the [GEOPREC] field. A value of "BLOCKFACE" indicates the entity was geocoded on the correct street segment (block) and correct side of the street. A value of "ONENTITY" indicates that the location is on the entity's facility, as determined by USGS DOQQ imagery, and that it is on the correct street segment (block) and correct side of the street. Entities that are part of a larger institution (e.g., University Campus or Military Base) with "BLOCKFACE" precision may be located at the main entrance to the larger institution.

        Records with "-DOD" appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        1) Entities were processed to determine or verify their name, physical address, city, state, five (5) digit zip code, phone number, and geospatial location. Entities not located on military bases were contacted and asked to describe their location relative to landmarks in reference data (mainly streets) and features visible in ortho imagery.
        >
        >
        2) Due to a request made by the Department of Defense, TGS made every effort to not contact military bases starting 03/27/2007 and ending 05/28/2008. During this time, entities located on military bases were verified through alternate resources, such as maps and ortho imagery. These records have not been contacted by TGS, and therefore, do not have directions.

    Attribute:
      Attribute_Label: CITY
      Attribute_Definition:
        The name of the city associated with the entity's physical address. For physical addresses that the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) delivers to, this should be a "city" acceptable to the USPS as defined in their Address Information System (AIS). Sometimes the USPS does not deliver mail to a physical address but recognizes the location (i.e., they list the location as "undeliverable"). The cities associated with these locations are acceptable. In some cases, the USPS does not recognize individual physical addresses in a city, rather, they list the city as having "General Delivery". In these cases, the city and associated zip code are acceptable (the entity's [ADDRESS] field will contain a street address, not "general delivery"). The entity may not actually be located within the city limits of the "city" specified in its [CITY] field. Instead, it may actually be located within the city limits of another city. In some cases, the "city" that appears in this field may not even be a city in an administrative sense, but it is still an acceptable "city" to the USPS. An example of this is "Notre Dame, IN". There is no city in Indiana called "Notre Dame", but this is considered an acceptable city by the USPS for any delivery going to the University of Notre Dame which is actually located in the city of South Bend. "Notre Dame", like most USPS cities, is an easily recognized place, and it gives the user of the data a good general idea of where the entity is located (if the entity is located in a small municipality, the USPS "city" may be more recognizable than the name of the municipality), and it would be part of the address one would use to send a shipment to the entity's location. Using the USPS acceptable "city" also allows someone to do a logical consistency check between the zip code and the city by using the USPS AIS.

        Sometimes an entity may report a city that is not accepted by the USPS, and although TGS has tried to replace those cities with an acceptable alternative, some of them may remain in this dataset.

However, there are cases, particularly where an entity is part of a larger facility that cuts across state lines, where the entity's location may be depicted in a state other than the one indicated in this field. Also, the state in which an entity appears to be located may change depending on the scale of the state boundary theme being used.

        NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) Description for entity. The "Index Entries" that appear on the NAICS webpage (<http://www.census.gov/epcd/www/naics.html>) are being used to populate this field, as opposed to the "NAICS Title". While there is a one to one correspondence between NAICS Codes and "NAICS Titles", there is a one to many relationship between NAICS Codes and the "Index Entries". By using the "Index Entries", we have placed the entities that make up this layer into more specific categories; however, the user of this data should be aware that this was not the intended purpose of these "Index Entries". The "Index Entries" were intended as a way to search the NAICS database and as a way of enumerating ways in which establishments falling under the given NAICS Code may be named. Thus, there are often two or more "Index Entries" that are synonyms, for example: "Prisons" and "Penitentiaries". In cases like this, we have standardized on one "Index Entry".

        NAICS Descriptions (and NAICS Codes) have been assigned based upon the entity's primary function, regardless of if that is the function that qualified it to be included in this dataset.
