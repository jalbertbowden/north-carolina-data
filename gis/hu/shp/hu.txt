  Description:
    Abstract:
      This data set is a complete digital hydrologic unit boundary layer to the Subwatershed (12-digit) 6th level
      for the State of North Carolina. This data set consists of geo-referenced digital data and associated attributes
      created in accordance with the "FGDC Proposal, Version 2.0 - Federal Standards For Delineation of Hydrologic
      Unit Boundaries 8/30/04"(http://www.ncgc.nrcs.usda.gov/products/datasets/watershed/). Delineation of coastal
      watershed boundaries presented unique issues within North Carolina. Coastal boundary lines were determined
      using NOAA Nautical charts to supplement the USGS base maps. The paper "Proposal to Change Hydrologic Unit
      Delineations over the Estaurine Waters of North Carolina", Randolph L. Ferguson, 3/30/2000, presents issues
      and the delineation process used in the coastal regions of North Carolina.
      Polygons are attributed with hydrologic unit codes for 4th level sub-basins, 5th level watersheds, 6th level
      subwatersheds, name, size, downstream hydrologic unit, type of watershed, non-contributing areas and flow
      modification. Arcs are attributed with the highest hydrologic unit code for each watershed, linesource and a
      metadata reference file.
    Purpose:
      The Watershed and Subwatershed hydrologic unit boundaries provide a uniquely identified and uniform method of
      subdividing large drainage areas. The smaller sized 6th level sub-watersheds (up to 40,000 acres) are useful for
      numerous application programs supported by a variety of local, State, and Federal Agencies. This data set is intended
      to be used as a tool for water-resource management and planning activities, particularly for site-specific and localized
      studies requiring a level of detail provided by large-scale map information. The dataset will be appended to a larger
      seamless nationally consistant geospatial database as other states complete their portion of the watershed boundary
      dataset.

  Use_Constraints: The distributor shall not be held liable for improper or incorrect use of this data, based on the description of appropriate/inappropriate uses described in this metadata document. It is strongly recommended that this data is directly acquired from the distributor and not indirectly through other sources which may have changed the data in some way. These data should not be used at scales greater than 1:24,000 for the purpose of identifying hydrographic watershed boundary feature locations in the 2008 Watershed Boundary Dataset. The Natural Resources Conservation Service should be acknowledged as the data source in products derived from these data. The 2008 Watershed Boundary Dataset is public information and may be interpreted by all organizations, agencies, units of government, or others based on needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate application of the data. Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to reassign to the Natural Resources Conservation Service any authority for the decisions they make.  The Natural Resources Conservation Service will not perform any evaluations of these maps or purposes related solely to State or local regulatory programs. Photographic or digital enlargement of these maps to scales greater than that at which they were originally delineated can result in misrepresentation of the data. If enlarged, the maps will not include the fine detail that would be appropriate for mapping at the small scale.  Digital data files are periodically updated. Files are dated, and users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data from the source distributor.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    There are no unclosed polygons, intersections without nodes, or polygons without labels or
    with more than one label. Arc/Info's topological correction program CLEAN was used to
    correct intersections without nodes, identify unclosed polygons and remove duplicate lines
    with the same beginning and ending nodes. All sliver polygons were removed either using
    eliminate, merge or manually in ArcEdit.
  Completeness_Report:
    All fields for all polygons in the .pat are attributed. Some polygons in the Ncontrb_a field might
    have a 0 value. All fields for the lines in the .aat are attributed. The lines adjacent to the
    universal polygon are attributed with a 0 for the hu_level. These cannot be attributed until the
    adjacent states complete their linework at which point the highest level of hydrologic unit can be
    determined.

        The WBD was revised in 2008 by the USGS using Enhanced USGS Digital Raster
        Graphics (DRG-Es) county mosaic MrSID images as a base map for the land data. This revision process
        brought all of the North Carolina WBD over-land boundary lines to be within a 12 meter buffer (+/- 40 feet)
        of where visual interpretation put the actual boundary for the DRG-E map base. Previous WBD work by the NRCS
        used either Enhanced Digital Raster Graphics (DRG-Es) images as source map for land data (work in 2002-2005)
        or data manually digitized from paper USGS 7.5' quadrangle maps (early work in 1993-1994). The WBD for North
        Carolina was started in 1993 using paper USGS quad maps and digitized into the NC Coordinate system, feet,
        NAD27. Edits since then have used this Coordinate base, until 2008 when the USGS used the reprojected WBD
        map in the North Carolina coordinate system, meters, and NAD83 for their revisions.
        Maps in other coordinate systems were produced using the ArcInfo 9 project utility from this revised 2008
        WBD base map. The WBD used NOAA Nautical Charts for over-water data, when the DRG-Es were not adequate.
        Data completeness for DRG files reflect content of the source graphic and may therefore be reflected in
        the completeness and accuracy of the WBD. The WBD map was digitized from USGS 1:24,000-scale digital raster
        graphic base maps, with accuracy being stated for this scale. Accuracy and adequacy of the WBD at any other
        scale shall be determined by the user. It should be noted that while general rules of hydrology were used
        (i.e. water flows downhill), the location of boundaries is still somewhat subjective as the 1:24,000-scale
        DRG-E do not always provide enough information for identifying the location of the boundaries. In these
        instances group consensus was used. In the extremely flat areas (such as the Great Dismal Swamp) located in
        the coastal plains of North Carolina, boundaries were adjusted for drainage effects and other surface flow
        impediments such as highways which act like dikes. Please refer to the methods section for more details on
        watershed delineation rules. Unquantifiable errors may be associated with coordinate shift (fuzzy tolerance
        was set to 0.0001 meters, double precision), dangle (set to 15 meters). The default was used for all other
        ArcEdit tolerances.  As with the original DRGs, DRG-E is cast in the Universal Transverse Mercator
        projection and is referenced to the NAD27 datum. When the DRG-Es are used in the NAD83 datum the alternate
        world files only approximate the NAD83 by shifting the coordinates of the imagery. The total error introduced
        using this shift is less than 2 meters for all DRG-E imagery.

  Overview_Description:
    Entity_and_Attribute_Overview:
      This is a description of attributes by field from the Federal Standards for Delineation of Hydrologic Unit Boundaries
      1) Polygon attributes
      Huc_8 : Eight Digit Hydrologic Unit Code  - (REQUIRED)
      A unique 8-digit code from the USGS map series "Hydrologic Unit Maps".  The same number was used in every record that
      pertains to a subwatershed that resides within the same 8-digit sub-basin. Numbers were assigned in an upstream to
      downstream fashion. Where no downstream/upstream relationship could be determined numbers were assigned in a clockwise
      fashion.

      Huc_10: Ten Digit Hydrologic Unit Code - (REQUIRED)
      This field provides a unique 10-digit code for each watershed.  This same number was used in every record that pertains
      to a subwatershed that resides within the same 10-digit watershed. Numbers were assigned in an upstream to downstream
      fashion. Where no downstream/upstream relationship could be determined numbers were assigned in a clockwise fashion.

      Huc_12: Twelve Digit Hydrologic Unit Code - (REQUIRED)
      This field provides a unique 12-digit code for each subwatershed.  Numbers were assigned in an upstream to downstream
      fashion. Where no downstream/upstream relationship could be determined numbers were assigned in a clockwise fashion.

      Acres:  Acres - (REQUIRED)
      Area of subwatershed including non-contributing areas calculated to acres as a whole number, no decimals.  The "Acres"
      field was calculated from the "Area" field.

      States: States - (REQUIRED)
      The "States" field includes the names of all state(s) that the subwatershed falls within.  The 2-digit postal abbreviation
      in upper case and in alphabetical order was used, separated with a comma.

      Ncontrb_a: Non-Contributing Area - (FIELD REQUIRED, ATTRIBUTES OPTIONAL)
      Drainage areas that do not flow toward the outlet of any hydrologic unit are considered non-contributing.  If a
      non-contributing area is on the boundary between two or more hydrologic units, the non-contributing area is associated
      with the hydrologic unit adjacent to the low point on the boundary. This attribute should be the total of the
      non-contributing areas within a hydrologic unit calculated in acres.

      Hu_10_ds: Fifth Level Downstream Hydrologic Unit Code - (FIELD REQUIRED, ATTRIBUTES OPTIONAL)
      This field has the 10-digit code of the 5th level hydrologic unit that is receiving the majority of the flow from the
      watershed that the 6th level HU falls within.  Outlets created by ditching or other artificial drainage were not
      considered for this field. If an HU flows into an ocean or the Gulf of Mexico, this field was populated with "OCEAN"
      and if a HU flows into one of the Great Lakes the term "LAKE" was used.  If a HU flows across international borders,
      "CANADA" or "MEXICO" was used depending on which country the HU drains into.  If an HU is  a closed basin, then the
      term "CLOSED BASIN"was used.

      Hu_10_name: Fifth Level Hydrologic Unit Name - (FIELD REQUIRED, ATTRIBUTES OPTIONAL)
      This field used officially recognized names only.  This field was populated by following the directions in subsection 6.3
      "Watershed and Subwatershed Naming Protocol".  The name used to attribute the watershed was used only once within a
      4th level unit.

      Hu_10_mod: Fifth Level Hydrologic Unit Modifications - (REQUIRED)
      This field identifies any type of modifications to natural overland flow that alters the location of the hydrologic
      unit boundary for a 10-digit watershed.  This field shows the most significant to least significant modification(s)
      to the watershed boundary.  One or more of the following abbreviations was used.
