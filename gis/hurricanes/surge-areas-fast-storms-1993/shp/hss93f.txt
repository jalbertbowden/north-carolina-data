  Description:
    Abstract:
      The National Hurricane Center, in cooperation with the
      North Carolina Center for Geographic Information and Analysis,
      developed the GIS data set, Hurricane Storm Surge Inundation
      Areas (1993), to reevaluate the extent of the areas affected
      by hurricane inundation along the North Carolina coast.  The data depicts
      the extent of hurricane storm surge inundation areas based
      on SLOSH (Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes)
      models, for the North Carolina coast. This is the metadata for the
      FAST model (those with forward velocities greater
      than 15mph). Storm surge  is the abnormal rise in water level caused
      by wind and pressure forces of a hurricane or tropical storm.
      The SLOSH model was developed using various combinations of hurricane
      strength (based on the Saffir-Simpson scale), wind speed, and direction of
      movement. Rainfall produced by a hurricane is not taken into account.
      This data is stored in a county library by county extent.
    Purpose:
      This data was created to assist governmental agencies and
      others in making resource management decisions through use of a Geographic
      Information System (GIS).
    Supplemental_Information:
      There are several county-based coverages associated with this data layer.
      The county names below show inundation limit file sizes for the 'fast'
      hurricanes (those with forward velocities greater than 15mph).  There are
      coverages depicting inundation limits for the 'slow'
      hurricanes (with forward velocities of less than or equal to 15mph) as well.

  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      All attributes were supplied by the National Hurricane Center
      Overlays labeled with attribute information were digitized and the
      attributes transferred to the digital file. Check plots were made
      and overlayed to the originals to check attribute accuracy.
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Using ESRI's ARC/INFO GIS software, the
    dataset was built for arc and polygon topology using the
    "build" command. The data set was then cleaned using the
    "clean" command.  Topology has not been edited since the
    last build or clean.
  Completeness_Report:
    These data show the extent of hurricane storm surge inundation
    areas based on SLOSH (Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from
    Hurricanes) for the North Carolina coast based on a National Hurricane
    Center 1993 study.  There are two coverages associated with the
    data layer: one showing limits for the 'fast' hurricanes and one
    showing limits for the 'slow' hurricanes.  The areas are labeled
    according to hurricane strength (on the Saffir-Simpson scale)
    measured by movement at miles per hour.

      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        Hurricane storm surge inundation areas were marked onto
        a third overlay, with 7.5 Minute USGS paper topographic maps
        (which meet National Map Accuracy Standards) and SLOSH
        plots underneath.  Boundaries drawn on the third overlay were digitized
        and check plots used to ensure correct boundary location, within a
        line width.

      Process_Description:
        SLOSH models, provided by the National Hurricane Center,
        and USGS topographic maps (with contour lines), were overlayed and
        inundation interpolation was done onto
        a third overlay.  The third overlay contained the limits of
        inundation according to categories 1 and 2, category 3, and
        categories 4 and 5 hurricanes.  Each limit, which was
        differentiated by color, was then digitized.  Check plots
        were made and overlayed to the originals for accuracy to a
        pen width of the original linework.  Any necessary corrections
        were made.  The coverages were then appended.
