  Description:
    Abstract:
      The US Geological Survey-National Mapping Division created
      the 1:24,000-scale Pipe and Transmission data for their
      published maps.  The NC Center for Geographic Information
      and Analysis, developed the NC statewide Transportation-
      Miscellaneous (1:24,000) digital data as a base layer
      showing pipe and transmission lines.  This data was compiled
      directly from the DLGs.  Apparent inconsistencies in specific
      areas may be due to different compliation dates of the source
      maps. Airports and landing strips have been removed and are
      stored in another file.
    Purpose:
      DLG's depict information about geographic features on or near
      the surface of the Earth, terrain, and political and administrative
      units.  These data were collected as part of the National Mapping
      Program. NC CGIA digitizes and distributes dlgs to help agencies
      and others make resource management and other types of decisions.

  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      The digital line graphs (DLGs)for miscellaneous
      transportation were delineated on USGS 1:24,000-scale topographic maps and
      attributed with USGS DLG codes.  The digital files were supplied to
      NCCGIA who makes attribute edits as errors are found.
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Using ESRI's ARC/INFO GIS software, the data set
    was built for arc topology using the "build" command. Topology has not been
    edited since the last build.
  Completeness_Report:
    These data represent miscellaneous transportation
    features, including pipe and transmission lines,
    as determined by the US Geological Survey 1:24,000-scale Digital Line
    Graph program, for statewide North Carolina. Each feature is attributed
    with various DLG codes.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        Miscellaneous transportation features were delineated on USGS
        7.5 Minute series topographic maps, which meet National Map Accuracy
        Standards. The DLGs were digitized and checked for positional accuracy
        at the USGS. These files, which originally met the National Map
        Accuracy Standards for 1:24,000-scale dlgs, have had
        minor edits performed as missing features have been added.

    Entity_and_Attribute_Overview:
      An arc coverage depicting the
      locations of miscellaneous transportation features, such as pipe and
      transmission lines, as delineated by the
      US Geological Survey.  The arc attribute table (AAT) has attribute data
      including to- and from-node identifiers, left- and right-side polygon
      identifiers, length of linear feature in feet, and two internal
      identification numbers.  There are six additional items, which describe
      the features, according to USGS Digital Line Graph codes.
