  Description:
    Abstract: CGIA developed this set of point locations for potential emergency shelters in North Carolina as part of a project for the Flood Innundation and Forecast Mapping System.  Structures selected to serve as shelters in disaster response will vary.  This set represent structures of the type that may be selected by local emergency managers, the Red Cross, or other disaster response agencies.
    Purpose:
      These data were created to assist governmental agencies and others in making resource management decisions through use of a Geographic Information System (GIS). These data are useful in many planning and emergency
      management operations.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: The attributes were loaded into the GIS from data supplied by the NC Department of Public Instruction, US Army Corps of Engineers, NC Community College System, Federal Emergency Management Agency (HAZUS 99), and the NC State Property Office. The values in this dataset are  deemed to be reliable.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: Using ESRI's ARC/INFO GIS software, the dataset was built for point topology using the "build" command.  Topology has not been edited since the last build or clean.
  Completeness_Report: The data represents those potential emergency shelters which were either address matched using ArcView geocoding or matched manually using the best available techniques. This data set does not contain all the potential emergency shelter locations in North Carolina, as other types of buildings may be appropriate for a specific event.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: The majority of potential emergency shelter locations were generated using geocoding in ArcView. The point generated in the processing would be snapped to the road identified in the address field.  Therefore, point locations are coincident with the GDT roads data.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: CGIA used a road network from GDT, Inc. with ArcView GIS to geocode the addresses. This process matched potential emergency shelters with a point on the road network. Point locations are approximate, based on an interpolation of street numbers along street segments. The resulting file was checked to determine which addresses did not match. These locations were then added to the coverage interactively, using GDT roads, Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quadrangels as backcovers.  Many of these point locations are coincident with the center of buildings on digital imagery or along driveways and may be more accurate than points located using the first method. Geographic layers from the NC Corporate Geographic Database to determine potential emergency shelter locations.
