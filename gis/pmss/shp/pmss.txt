  Description:
    Abstract:
      The NC Center for Geographic Information and Analysis developed the
      GIS data set, Public Municipal Stormwater Systems, as mapped by contractors
      to the NC Rural Center (engineering firms McGill & Associates and
      Hobbs, Upchurch & Associates) during 2004, 2005, and 2006 to facilitate
      planning, siting and impact analysis in the 100 individual counties of
      North Carolina. This file enables the user to make various county-level
      determinations when used in conjunction with other data layers. The survey was in 2004, so this data would normally have been for calendar year 2003.
    Purpose:
      The purpose of this data set is to inform users of key information about
      Public Municipal Stormwater Systems in North Carolina, with particular focus
      on system size and growth, regulatory compliance, and capital improvement
      needs of the systems.
    Supplemental_Information:
      Revisions and updates to this layer include:
      1.) March 2007 version was the first recorded release of this data.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        The contractors collected graphic data from water and sewer
        system managers, and collected numeric data from water, sewer,
        and stormwater system managers throughout North Carolina.
        Graphic data was collected in one of two ways.  If the system
        of interest was evaluated during the prior system survey of
        1998, the new graphic data was collected by forwarding or
        delivering to each system manager a map of the water or sewer
        system pipes as they existed in 1998, having the system
        manager adjust system boundaries to reflect current and
        expected future boundaries, and making those edits to the
        1998 polygons.  If the system of interest was not evaluated
        in the 1998 survey, a map of the current and expected future
        boundaries of the system was requested from the system manager.
        In both cases, the current and expected future boundaries of
        the water or sewer system were ultimately digitized from the
        data provided by the system manager.  In some cases, system
        managers reported no change in current or expected future
        system boundaries, and in those cases the resulting polygons
        are identical to those produced from the 1998 survey.  For
        this study, current system boundaries were defined as those
        boundaries in existence at the time of the survey (2004).
        Future system boundaries were defined as the boundaries
        expected to exist in the year 2010.
        Numeric data was collected by crafting a table structure for
        the required data, forwarding a paper questionnaire developed
        from this data structure to each system manager, collecting
        that data as a written response to the questionnaire (via
        return mail or face-to-face meeting), then entering this data
        into the table structure.

        AMEC Earth and Environmental, Inc. of North Carolina (AMEC)
        took responsibility for managing the data structure, data
        connectivity, and quality control aspects of the graphic
        and numeric data generated for this project.  AMEC integrated
        individual polygons into a statewide coverage of systems of
        various types, and also performed quality control reviews
        on numeric data and data ranges for numeric fields.  AMEC
        identified disconnections between polygons and the underlying
        tabular data and worked with the other contractors and CGIA
        to rectify these disconnects.  Using linear multivariate
        regression techniques, AMEC estimated current and future
        capital improvement needs for systems which had no published
        capital improvement plans.
