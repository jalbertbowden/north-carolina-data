  Description:
    Abstract:
      North Carolina Sea Grant and the North Carolina
      Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Division
      of Parks and Recreation, in cooperation with the NC Center
      for Geographic Information and Analysis, developed the
      digital geographic information system (GIS) Paddle Trails, Coastal Plain
      data to as part of an ongoing effort to inventory and publicize
      watertrails through DPR's trails programs.  This data contains
      the trail locations and access points for the inventoried trails
      in the coastal plain of North Carolina. Other trails in the
      coastal plain and in other portions of the state are to be
      inventoried as resources allow.
    Purpose:
      This data was created as part of the North Carolina Coastal Plain
      Paddle Trails Initiative, a private grant funded program with
      NC Sea Grant.  This initiative consisted off multiple parts that
      ranged from a paddler's inventory to economic impact assessments.
      This effort has developed an understanding of how paddling and paddling
      related actions impact and interact with the environment, local
      establishment and infrastructure and can help guide efforts in
      the development of ecotourism.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      The attribute values in this data were input from existing
      hardcopy source maps or from compiled descriptions created
      by the NC DPR trials coordinator.  The content was reveiwed
      using multiple hardcopy printouts and maps, and cross-checked
      with the descriptive content on the paddle trails website.
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Using ESRI's ARC/INFO GIS software, the dataset was built for
    arc topology using the "build" command. The data
    set was then cleaned with the default fuzzy tolerance of 32.434 feet,
    a value within the 40 ft NMAS for 1:24,000-scale data. Topology
    has not been edited since the last build or clean.
  Completeness_Report:
    These mapped trails were the trails recognized by the DPR trails
    program as meeting some basic requirments as of the creation date
    of this data.  For information on these requirements, contact
    NC DPR (919) 778-9499
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The trail locations were digitized on screen using buffers
        and offsets from existing hydrography shoreline files.  These
        1:100,000 and 1:24,000-scale hydro features are also used as
        the background hydro features on the printed maps and graphics.
        This method of data creation enable the best presentation by
        ensure direct overlay of trails on their respective hydrographic
        bodies.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Using on-screen digitizing, the location of paddle trails
        identified on existing maps were transferred into a GIS
        digital file.  Node features were created and coded to
        represent the location of trail access points. Lines were
        created by buffering or off-setting new line locations from
        existing shoreline features in the hydrography source data.
        Feature locations were determined by using the GIS to overlay
        various thematic layers and by underlying aerial imagery.
