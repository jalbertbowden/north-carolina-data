  Description:
    Abstract:
      NC Center for Geographic Information and Analysis developed the digital
      Public Libraries data from addresses provided by the State Library
      of North Carolina on 3/20/03.  This file enables users to identify public
      library locations. This data covers the entire extent of North Carolina.
    Purpose:
      This data was created to assist governmental agencies and others
      in making resource management decisions through use of a Geographic
      Information System (GIS).

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      Point locations were generated using geocoding in Arcview from
      the public libraries address list provided by the State
      Library of North Carolina on 3/20/03.  Points that could not be
      generated using geocoding were interactively added in arcedit using
      mapquest.com.  This digital file is updated as changes occur.
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Using ESRI's ARC/INFO GIS software, the dataset was built for
    point topology using the "build" command.  Topology has not been
    edited since the last build or clean.
  Completeness_Report:
    These data represent the locations of Public Libraries in North
    Carolina as listed by the State Library of North Carolina.  The locations
    were either address-matched using ArcView geocoding or matched manually
    using mapquest.com.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The majority of Public Libraries were generated using geocoding
        in Arcview.  The point generated in the processing would be snapped to
        the road identified in the address field.  Therefore, point locations
        are coincident with the GDT roads data.
