  Description:
    Abstract: The North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Division of Environmental Health, Public Water Supply Section in cooperation with the NC Center for Geographic Information and Analysis, has developed the geographic data to provide accurate location of public water supply system sources in North Carolina.
    Purpose: These data were created for North Carolina's Source Water Assessment Program and to assist governmental agencies and others in making resource management decisions through use of a Geographic Information System (GIS).

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: The well locations were collected with Trimble GeoExplorer using data dictionary developed by PWSS which allowed field input of system id, well id, distance and direction to well, etc. during the collection of satellite readings. Following conversion to tabular text, cross-checking with the existing database and editing were made.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: Using Trimble's Pathfinder software, the data from GPS units were differentially corrected and converted to GIS format to be used with ESRI's ArcGIS software.
  Completeness_Report: These GPS derived locations are obtained incidental to routine water system inspections, sanitary surveys, and site visits. The locating of the public water supply sources is the first step in wellhead protection. Accurately locating PWS sources will enable other divisions/agencies to determine what potentially harmful activities are within specified distances of these wells.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: Well locations were differentially corrected using base station files, which resulted in positions within 2m to 5m of the actual positions.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: PWSS regions' GPS rover units data were transferred to DEH server. Well locations were calculated by using Pathfinder software and base station files. The data were then converted to tabular text form so they could be imported into ArcGIS software for visual inspection purpose. The data were reviewed and necessary corrections made.
