  Description:
    Abstract: The North Carolina Department of Commerce, Division of Community Assistance and the NC Geodetic Survey developed North Carolina Protected Mountain Ridges data to enhance enforcement of the Mountain Ridge Protection Act of 1983 and 1985 amendment.  This file enables users to identify areas within North Carolina where there are protected ridges and associated building height limitations.  No updates are planned unless further Act amendments by the General Assembly of North Carolina.
    Purpose: Identification of protected ridges as required by the Mountain Ridge Protection Act of 1983, G.S. 113A Article 14.
    Supplemental_Information:
      YELLOW Category: identifies a ridge for protection because it has an elevation of 3,000 or more feet AND it rises 500 feet or more above the valley floor.
      ORANGE Category: indicates that a ridge identified for protection with an elevation of 3,000 feet or higher also forms the COMMON BOUNDARY between two counties.
      GREEN Category: identifies a ridge or part or a ridge rising 500 feet or more above the valley floor, but having an elevation of LESS than the 3,000 or more feet defining primary eligibility for protection in the Act.
      BLUE Category: indicates that a ridge identified for protection rising 500 feet or more above the valley floor, but having LESS than 3,000 feet foot elevation, also forms the COMMON BOUNDARY between two counties.
      The degree and kind of protection to which ridges identified for protection are subject is dependant on which options available under the Act are chosen by the local government units having jurisdiction. For that reason, if ridges rising 500 feet or more above the valley floor, but with less than 3,000 foot elevation, have been identified on this map, their actual protection under the act is entirely dependent on whether or not the local government with jurisdiction has elected to remove the act's 3,000 foot elevation requirement. Local government authorities should be consulted to determine applicable ridge protection when interpreting this map.
      See: http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/RTF/ByArticle/Chapter_113A/Article_14.rtf  for the full text of the act.
      Ridge means the elongated crest or series of crests at the apex or uppermost point of intersection between two opposite slopes or sides of a mountain, and includes all land within 100 feet below the elevation of any portion of such line or surface along the crest. Ridge protection extends by 100 vertical feet on both sides of a ridge.  Within this area, tall buildings are prohibited from measuring over 40 feet from the top of the foundation to the top of the building or protruding over 35 feet above the crest of the ridge.

  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: The NC Department of Natural Resources and Community Development drew the original lines for protected ridges on 7.5 Minute USGS paper topographic maps.  NC Division of Community Assistance and the NC Geodetic Survey digitized these protected ridge lines 'on screen' using DRG 7.5 Minute USGS topographic maps as the base. The NC Geodetic Survey edited these lines for Ridge Law category mapping purposes.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: None
  Completeness_Report:
    These data represent the locations of protected ridges as mapped on 7.5 Minute USGS paper topographic maps in 1984 and 1985.  These are the official protected ridges as delineated under the Mountain Ridge Protection Act.
    The ridge identification lines are only for the purpose of identifying protected ridges.  They are not meant to show the extent of the 100 foot elevation protection zone.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: Protected ridge lines were marked on 7.5 Minute USGS paper topographic maps.  'On screen' digitizing utilized the same 7.5 Minute USGS  topographic map base, using a best estimate with reference to surrounding features.
