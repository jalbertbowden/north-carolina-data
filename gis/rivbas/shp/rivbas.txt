  Data_Set_Credit:
    Funding for the North Carolina Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) was provided by the U.S. Department of
    Agriculture-Natural Resources Conservation Service, North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural
    Resources (NCDENR)-Division of Coastal Management, and the US Geological Survey. Representatives from the
    NCDENR-Division of Coastal Management, NCDENR-Division of Land Resources-Geological Survey,
    NCDENR-Division of Water Quality, NCDENR-Division of Water Resources, NCDENR-Division of Water
    Resources-Groundwater Section, ITS-Center for Geographic Information and Analysis, US Geological Survey
    (USGS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and US Fish and Wildlife Service contributed a
    substantial amount of time and salary towards oversight and quality review of the dataset.
    Special recognition goes to Randy Ferguson (NOAA), Ted Mew (NCDENR), Kathleen Farrell (NCDENR), Alan
    Clark (NCDENR), and Silvia Terziotti (USGS) who contributed greatly of their time and expertise to guide
    this project and develop the science necessary to produce this Watershed Boundary Dataset. Additionally,
    a special thanks to Karen Hanson (USGS) and Sarah Walton (USGS) for all their hard work revising the WBD
    and adding the final touches.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    There are no unclosed polygons, intersections without nodes, or polygons without labels or
    with more than one label. Arc/Info's topological correction program CLEAN was used to
    correct intersections without nodes, identify unclosed polygons and remove duplicate lines
    with the same beginning and ending nodes. All sliver polygons were removed either using
    eliminate, merge or manually in ArcEdit.
  Completeness_Report:
    All fields for all polygons in the .pat are attributed. Some polygons in the Ncontrb_a field might
    have a 0 value. All fields for the lines in the .aat are attributed. The lines adjacent to the
    universal polygon are attributed with a 0 for the hu_level. These cannot be attributed until the
    adjacent states complete their linework at which point the highest level of hydrologic unit can be
    determined.

      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The WBD was revised in 2008 by the USGS using Enhanced USGS Digital Raster
        Graphics (DRG-Es) county mosaic MrSID images as a base map for the land data. This revision process
        brought all of the North Carolina WBD over-land boundary lines to be within a 12 meter buffer (+/- 40 feet)
        of where visual interpretation put the actual boundary for the DRG-E map base. Previous WBD work by the NRCS
        used either Enhanced Digital Raster Graphics (DRG-Es) images as source map for land data (work in 2002-2005)
        or data manually digitized from paper USGS 7.5' quadrangle maps (early work in 1993-1994). The WBD for North
        Carolina was started in 1993 using paper USGS quad maps and digitized into the NC Coordinate system, feet,
        NAD27. Edits since then have used this Coordinate base, until 2008 when the USGS used the reprojected WBD
        map in the North Carolina coordinate system, meters, and NAD83 for their revisions.
        Maps in other coordinate systems were produced using the ArcInfo 9 project utility from this revised 2008
        WBD base map. The WBD used NOAA Nautical Charts for over-water data, when the DRG-Es were not adequate.
        Data completeness for DRG files reflect content of the source graphic and may therefore be reflected in
        the completeness and accuracy of the WBD. The WBD map was digitized from USGS 1:24,000-scale digital raster
        graphic base maps, with accuracy being stated for this scale. Accuracy and adequacy of the WBD at any other
        scale shall be determined by the user. It should be noted that while general rules of hydrology were used
        (i.e. water flows downhill), the location of boundaries is still somewhat subjective as the 1:24,000-scale
        DRG-E do not always provide enough information for identifying the location of the boundaries. In these
        instances group consensus was used. In the extremely flat areas (such as the Great Dismal Swamp) located in
        the coastal plains of North Carolina, boundaries were adjusted for drainage effects and other surface flow
        impediments such as highways which act like dikes. Please refer to the methods section for more details on
        watershed delineation rules. Unquantifiable errors may be associated with coordinate shift (fuzzy tolerance
        was set to 0.0001 meters, double precision), dangle (set to 15 meters). The default was used for all other
        ArcEdit tolerances.  As with the original DRGs, DRG-E is cast in the Universal Transverse Mercator
        projection and is referenced to the NAD27 datum. When the DRG-Es are used in the NAD83 datum the alternate
        world files only approximate the NAD83 by shifting the coordinates of the imagery. The total error introduced
        using this shift is less than 2 meters for all DRG-E imagery.
