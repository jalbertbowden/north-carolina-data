  Description:
    Abstract:
      The US Geological Survey-National Mapping Division created
      the 1:100,000-scale Railroads data from their published maps. The 1:24,000
      scale railroads were derived from USGS's DLG (Digital Line Graph) Program
      The NC Center for Geographic Information and Analysis, combined these
      two data sources to develop the NC statewide Transportation-Railroads
      digital data as a base layer showing railroad features. 24 k data was
      use when duplicate tracks existed from both sources.
    Purpose:
      This data was created to assist governmental
      agencies and others in making resource management
      decisions through use of a Geographic Information System (GIS).

  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      The digital line graphs (DLGs)for
      transportation - railroads were delineated on USGS 1:100,000-scale
      topographic maps and 1:24,000 scale topographic maps and attributed
      with USGS DLG codes.  The digital files were supplied to NC CGIA who
      edits the attributes as changes occur.  The two datasets were merged
      to fill in gaps that occured in both datasets allowing for a more
      complete statewide railroad coverage.
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Using ESRI's ARC/INFO GIS software, the data set was built for arc topology
    using the "build" command. Topology has not been edited since the last
    build.
  Completeness_Report:
    These data represent transportation features for railroads, as determined
    by the US Geological Survey 1:100,000-scale Digital Line Graph program and
    1:24,000-scale Digital Line Graph program. Each feature is attributed with
    various DLG codes. Data represent all known railroads at time of publication
    of sources.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        Features were delineated on USGS 30 x 60 Minute and 7.5 minute series
        topographic maps, which meet National Map Accuracy Standards. The
        DLGs were digitized and supplied to NC CGIA who converted them into
        ARC/INFO format. The data was projected, and features are added as
        changes occur.

      Process_Description:
        For Digital Revision Status = Not digitally revised:
        This Digital Line Graph was digitized from the USGS source
        quadrangle, by either the National Mapping Division, one of
        their cooperators, or one of their contractors.  The digital data
        were produced by one of the following methods:
        - scanning a stable-based copy of the graphic materials.
        The scanning process captured the digital data at a
        scanning resolution of at least 0.001 inches;  the
        resulting raster data were vectorized and then attributed
        on an interactive editing station.
        o scanning the paper map.  The scanning process captured
        the digital data at a scanning resolution of at least
        0.001 inches;  the resulting raster data were vectorized
        and then attributed on an interactive editing station.
        - scanning a stable-based copy of the graphic materials.
        The resulting raster data were then manually digitized
        and attributed on an interactive editing station.  The
        resolution of the digital data is at least 0.001 inches.
        o scanning the paper map.  The resulting raster data were
        then manually digitized and attributed on an interactive
        editing station.  The resolution of the digital data is
        at least 0.001 inches.
        - manually digitizing from a stable-based copy of the
        graphic material using a digitizing table to capture the
        digital data at a resolution of at least 0.001 inches;
        attribution was performed either as the data were
        digitized, or on an interactive edit station after the
        digitizing was completed.
        - manually digitizing from the paper map using a digitizing
        table to capture the digital data at a resolution of at
        least 0.001 inches;  attribution was performed either as
        the data were digitized, or on an interactive edit
        station after the digitizing was completed.
        The determination of the DLG production method was based on
        various criteria, including feature density, feature
        symbology, and availability of production systems.  Four
        control points corresponding to the four corners of the
        quadrangle were used for registration during data
        collection.  An eight parameter projective transformation
        was performed on the coordinates used in the data collection
        and editing systems to register the digital data to the
        internal coordinates used in PROSYS, and a four parameter linear
        transformation was performed from the PROSYS internal coordinates
        to Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid coordinates.  The DLG
        data were checked for position by one or more of the following
        processes:
        - comparing plots of the digital data to the graphic source.
        - comparing the digital data to the digital raster scan.
        DLG data classification was checked by at least one of the
        following processes.
        - comparing plots of the digital data to the graphic source
        - comparing the digital data to the digital raster scan.

        NCCGIA received the dlg linework for the railroads from the USGS
        in a digital format.  These files were refined at NCCGIA, including
        edgematching, deletion of neatlines. Errors in dlg label codes or
        inconsistencies in label order are corrected as they are found.
        Additional linework is added as needed. The 24,000 and 100,000 scale
        data was combined into one statewide file for ease of use.

      An arc coverage depicting the
      locations of railroads mapped in both 1:24,000 and 1:100,000 scales
      delineated by the US Geological Survey.  The arc attribute table (AAT) has
      data including to- and from-node identifiers, left- and right-
      side polygon identifiers, length of linear feature in meters, and two
      internal identification numbers.  There are three additional items, which
      describe the features, according to USGS Digital Line Graph codes, as well
      as a base map scale attribute.
