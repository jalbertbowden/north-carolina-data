  Description:
    Abstract:
      The NCREDC in conjunction with Hobbs, Upchurch & Associates
      developed the digital Sewer system discharges as mapped by
      individual system owners as required by contract. The data
      collected will facilitate planning, siting and impact analysis
      in the 70 individual counties of North Carolina. This file
      enables the user to make various county-level determinations
      when used in conjunction with other data layers. This data
      contains information on sewage discharges, including: discharge
      ID, location description, original construction date, and latest renovation
      date. Other coverages exist with sewer lines and other appurtenances.
    Purpose:
      This data was created to assist governmental agencies and
      others in making resource management decisions through use
      of a Geographic Information System (GIS).
    Supplemental_Information:
      The water and sewer data was collected in multiple phases.  There
      is an associated owner and contact table (wsp2cont.dbf) for the
      phase 2 counties which include:
      Beaufort, Bertie, Bladen, Brunswick, Camden, Caswell,
      Chatham, Chowan, Columbus, Currituck, Dare, Duplin, Franklin,
      Gates, Granville, Greene, Halifax, Harnett, Hertford, Hoke, Hyde,
      Iredell, Jones, Lee, Lenoir, Lincoln, Martin, Montgomery, Moore,
      Northampton, Onslow, Pasquotank, Pender, Perquimans, Pitt, Richmond,
      Robeson, Sampson, Scotland, Stanly, Union, Vance, Warren,
      Washington and Wilson counties. 45 counties.

      Phase 1 counties included:
      Alexander, Alleghany, Ashe, Avery, Buncombe, Burke, Caldwell,
      Cherokee, Clay, Cleveland, Davie, Forsyth, Graham, Haywood,
      Henderson, Jackson, Macon, Madison, McDowell, Mitchell, Polk,
      Rutherford, Stokes, Surry, Swain, Transylvania, Watauga, Wilkes,
      Yadkin, and Yancey counties. 30 counties.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      Hobbs, Upchurch & Associates digitized locations from various maps
      and GPS location points. All tabular data was supplied by the owner
      or received by Public Sewer Supply information. For more information
      on data sources and contacts, see the "Owner and Contact Table".
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Using ESRI's ArcCAD GIS software, the data set was built for
    nodal topology using the "build" command. Topology has not been
    edited since the last build or clean.
  Completeness_Report:
    This data layer represents the sewer intake locations and tabular data
    supplied by the owner of each system. For more information on data
    sources and contacts, see the "Owner and Contact Table".
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        Sewer discharges were heads-up digitized to match with the state
        supplied base mapping. In some cases GPS location was used.
        The overall threshold however is 40 feet or less. For more
        information on data sources and contacts, see the "Owner
        and Contact Table".

        was performed in AutoCAD R12-14/ArcCAD with NC DOT supplied
        road centerlines and hydro. Digital files were then converted
        into ArcView 3.0 Shape files with the appropriate dBase
        information. The data was completed in NAD83 Meters.

      Process_Description:
        Sewer intake files by county were mappjoined into one statewide
        GIS coverage using ARC/INFO GIS software.  On-screen review of
        the data and attributes was performed by a GIS analyst to make
        sure the processing did not change the data. The draft metadata
        supplied by Hobbs, Upchurch and Associates was finalized for
        inclusion into the Corporate Geographic Database.  An additional
        table containing source data contact and system owner information
        was created by HUA and has been incorporated into the data
        available through CGIA.
