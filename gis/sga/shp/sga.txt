  Description:
    Abstract: The North Carolina (NC) Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Division of Marine Fisheries (DMF) - Shellfish Sanitation and Recreational Water Quality Section (SSRWQ) identifies Designated Shellfish Growing Areas (SGA) covering the entire NC coast.  The SSRWQ performs water sampling at designated stations throughout the year to determine the extent of contamination of waters in each SGA. Based on these results, shoreline survey information, and hydrographic factors, the DMF disseminates proclamations to create closed harvesting areas with specified closure boundaries, in which the harvest of shellfish is prohibited.  Waters within each SGA may be permanently closed (prohibited), open (approved), or subject to being opened or closed (conditionally approved  open or conditionally approved  closed) based on an existing management plan for the area.
    Purpose: To delineate the designated shellfish growing areas of North Carolina and the classify harvesting areas within each SGA.

  Completeness_Report: Dataset is a complete representation of all shellfish growing areas in North Carolina.
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: Using a GIS software (ESRI's ARCGIS) polygons were created to represent shellfish growing areas as well as non-growing areas for a complete representation of coastal areas. Shellfish growing areas were delineated using 1:24,000-scale maps, 1:12,000-scale ortho imagery, and 1:200-scale GPS points for reference. GPS data collected using Trimble GeoXT handheld GPS units in the field. Data has been differentially corrected, either in real-time or through post-processing, in order to reduce error. Corrected data should achieve sub-meter accuracy, according to manufacturer specifications.
