  Description:
    Abstract:
      The North Carolina Department of Administration, State
      Property Office, in cooperation with the NC Center for Geographic
      Information and Analysis, developed the GIS data set, State-owned
      Complexes, to define the exterior boundaries of state-owned complexes
      in North Carolina; e.g.:DOT maintenance yards, state parks, state
      universities, etc.
    Purpose:
      This data was created to assist governmental agencies
      and others in making resource management decisions through use of a Geographic Information System (GIS).

      10.) Regular update.  July 22, 2002.
      9.) Regular update.  March 29, 2000.
      8.) The June 28, 1999 update includes addition of
      several polygons to the coverage and deletion of the arc attribute
      table (.aat).
      7.) The December 1998 update to this layer consisted
      of projecting the data from NAD27 datum, State Plane projection, units
      of measure feet TO: NAD83 DATUM, State Plane PROJECTION, UNITS OF MEASURE
      METERS.  This was done to comply with the NC Geographic Information
      Coordinating Council's "Statement of Direction for North Carolina
      Corporate Geographic Database Horizontal Reference, Datum and Unit of
      Measure".  This reprojecting was done in various ways depending on the
      data type and content.  Vector data was projected using the 'project'
      command in ESRI's Arc software and topology was cleaned and built based
      on coverage needs.  Raster data was projected using ESRI's Grid module
      and various steps as applicable.
      6.) Revision on April 28, 1998 consisted of
      the addition of several complexes.
      5.) Revision on August 8, 1996 consisted
      of the addition of several complexes.
      4.) (previously named nc.soc995)
      The September 8, 1995 revision consisted of the addition of
      several complexes, as well as polygon attribute item changes.
      3.) (previously named nc.soc1094)
      The October 26, 1994 revision consisted of the removal of
      a bogus polygon.
      2.) (previously named nc.soc794)
      The July 14, 1994 update consisted of replacing lookup tables
      with new items in the polygon attribute table.
      1.) (previously named nc.soc793)
      The July 1993 file was still a current representation as
      of February 18, 1994.

  Access_Constraints:
    Spatial data accuracy varies greatly in this data layer due to the
    wide variety of data sources used for compilation.  This spatial data
    layer should be used for illustrative and planning purposes only, and
    should not be accepted as definitive in any legal dispute or other
    situation where precise ownership data is required.  The SPO can provide
    some information concerning the source data and compilation method used
    for complexes in particular counties.  The State Property Office is notified
    monthly of the users of this data.

    DISCLAIMER: The State Property Office databases are continually updated
    as new information is acquired.  The locational database at CGIA is
    updated as needed for applications.  Users should determine from CGIA
    the date of the last update, and if necessary, see that an update is
    done prior to their application being run.  All printed maps from the
    GIS should be dated.  Depending on activity in a given area, a map may
    quickly become outdated, or may remain current for several years.  It
    is not possible to set a specific expiration date on maps; however,
    you may wish to check with the State Property Office for accuracy.
    All land records have a start date and were entered into the
    GIS with the best knowledge available from several different sources.
    The State Property Office is planning to go through a reconciliation
    process in 1994, which would hopefully clear up any discrepancies.
  Use_Constraints:
    Acknowledgement of products derived form this data set should cite the
    following: The source of the State-owned Complexes data is the NC OneMap.
    Earlier versions of this data set may exist. The user must be sure to use
    the appropriate data set for the time period of interest.  While efforts
    have been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within
    the state of the art, CGIA cannot assume liability for any damages or
    misrepresentation caused by any inaccuracies in the data or as a result
    of changes to the data caused by system transfers.

      Process_Description:
        Data were supplied by the counties in the state.
        Since each county was at their own stage of data
        development, complex sites were furnished by means
        of digital cadastral data, paper orthophoto quads,
        paper maps, or deeds.  Scales of maps varied from
        1:50 through 1:24,000. Those sites delineated on
        maps were digitized and then appended to data
        originally supplied in digital form, to produce
        a final file.
