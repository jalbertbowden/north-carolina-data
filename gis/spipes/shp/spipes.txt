  Description:
    Abstract:
      The NCREDC in conjunction with Hobbs, Upchurch & Associates
      developed the digital sewer pipe network as mapped by
      individual system owners as required by contract. The data
      collected will facilitate planning, siting and impact analysis
      in the 70 individual counties of North Carolina. This file
      enables the user to make various county-level determinations
      when used in conjunction with other data layers. This data
      contains information on sewer pipes, including: original
      construction date, lastest renovation date, material type,
      pipe diameter, type of flow, and pipe utilization. Other
      coverages exist with other appurtenances.
    Purpose:
      This data was created to assist governmental agencies and
      others in making resource management decisions through use
      of a Geographic Information System (GIS).
    Supplemental_Information:
      The water and sewer data was collected in multiple phases.  There
      is an associated owner and contact table (wsp2cont.dbf) for the
      phase 2 counties which include:
      Beaufort, Bertie, Bladen, Brunswick, Camden, Caswell,
      Chatham, Chowan, Columbus, Currituck, Dare, Duplin, Franklin,
      Gates, Granville, Greene, Halifax, Harnett, Hertford, Hoke, Hyde,
      Iredell, Jones, Lee, Lenoir, Lincoln, Martin, Montgomery, Moore,
      Northampton, Onslow, Pasquotank, Pender, Perquimans, Pitt, Richmond,
      Robeson, Sampson, Scotland, Stanly, Union, Vance, Warren,
      Washington and Wilson counties. 45 counties.

      Phase 1 counties included:
      Alexander, Alleghany, Ashe, Avery, Buncombe, Burke, Caldwell,
      Cherokee, Clay, Cleveland, Davie, Forsyth, Graham, Haywood,
      Henderson, Jackson, Macon, Madison, McDowell, Mitchell, Polk,
      Rutherford, Stokes, Surry, Swain, Transylvania, Watauga, Wilkes,
      Yadkin, and Yancey counties. 30 counties.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      Hobbs, Upchurch & Associates digitized sewer distribution networks from
      owner supplied maps and digital files. All tabular data was supplied by
      the owner or field verified by Hobbs, Upchurch. For more information on
      data sources and contacts, see the "Owner and Contact Table".
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Using ESRI's ArcCAD GIS software, the data set was built for
    linear topology using the "build" command. Topology has not been
    edited since the last build or clean.
  Completeness_Report:
    This data layer represents the sewer distribution network and tabular
    data supplied by the owner of each system. For more information on data
    sources and contacts, see the "Owner and Contact Table".
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The sewer distribution network was heads-up digitized to match with the
        state supplied base mapping. In some cases actual road centerlines were
        used. The overall threshold however is 40 feet or less. All features were
        verified by both HUA engineers as well as NCREDC for accuracy. For more
        information on data sources and contacts, see the "Owner and Contact Table".

        Hobbs, Upchurch & Associates digitized/compiled maps supplied
        by the participating counties. Also all tabular data was input
        into the CGIA supplied data standard. All heads-up digitizing
        was performed in AutoCAD R12-14/ArcCAD with NC DOT supplied
        road centerlines and hydro. Digital files were then converted
        into ArcView 3.0 Shape files with the appropriate dBase
        information. The data was completed in NAD83 Meters. Once compiled,
        the data was delivered to John Soles at NCREDC for review and supplied
        to the appropriate officials for each county for review for accurateness.

      Process_Description:
        The sewer distribution networks were mappjoined into one statewide
        GIS coverage using ARC/INFO GIS software.  On-screen review of
        the data and attributes was performed by a GIS analyst to make
        sure the processing did not change the data. The draft metadata
        supplied by Hobbs, Upchurch and Associates was finalized for
        inclusion into the Corporate Geographic Database.  An additional
        table containing source data contact and system owner information
        was created by HUA and has been incorporated into the data
        available through CGIA.
