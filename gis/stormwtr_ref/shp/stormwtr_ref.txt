  Description:
    Abstract:
      The NC Center for Geographic Information and Analysis (CGIA) collaborated with the NC Division of Water Quality (DWQ) to develop a geospatial representation of stormwater permitting responsibility across the state.  This reference layer represents permitting authority (local, state, multiple, or none) based on Phase II stormwater legislation, as well as other state and local programs that impose stormwater requirements.  This dataset is based on the best available datasets as of the publication.  This dataset uses mapped boundaries of all of North Carolina's
      counties as a base layer.
    Purpose: These data are intended to assist government agencies and their constituents in identifying which stormwater permitting requirements, if any, apply to a given location in North Carolina.  This data set includes attributes relating to stormwater programs (nutrient management strategy areas/local governments, water supply watersheds, high quality and outstanding waters areas, etc.) and jurisdictions, including federally managed areas (e.g., military bases).
    Supplemental_Information:
      The delineation and classification of stormwater areas is based on the following description of North Carolina stormwater programs.

      Post-Construction? requirements are a piece of the Phase II stormwater requirements for development projects in designated municipalities, their ETJs, urbanizing areas, and ?municipal sphere of influence? (MSI) boundaries around all Phase II municipalities.  Either the State (DWQ) or the local government (city or county, depending) will implement Post-Construction requirements.
      There are other existing Stormwater Programs that, in some cases, satisfy the Phase II Post-Construction requirements.  These do not change the areas where Phase II applies, but these other programs may dictate what the developer must do and/or from whom he/she gets approval for a plan.  The following is a summary of how these programs interact:

      Phase II Municipalities:
      Phase II Post-Construction is implemented in all Phase II municipalities and corresponding ETJs (with a few exceptions), even inside cities that were ?exempted? from a permit to run their own program either 1) because of population or 2) because they do not own or operate a municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4).  If the municipality has an MS4 permit, it will implement the requirements.  For ?exempted? entities, DWQ (or another delegated authority) implements Post-Construction within those jurisdictions instead.  Other stormwater programs also still apply (and some may be ?deemed compliant? with Phase II).  Therefore, in jurisdictions of exempted municipalities, the State (DWQ) implements Phase II, unless another program satisfies the requirement.  For exempted Phase II municipalities where no other program is in place, the Central Office DWQ is the contact in non-coastal counties, and the DWQ Regional Office is the contact in coastal counties.

      State Stormwater (State SW) Program:
      This program affects all 20 Coastal Counties, as well as watersheds draining to High Quality Waters (HQW) and Outstanding Resource Waters (ORW).  It is specific to development in these areas and, for the most part, this program is implemented by the DWQ Regional Offices (ROs).  Since the Coastal Stormwater Rules were revised in October 2008, it is no longer necessary to distinguish whether HQW and ORW waters are fresh- or saltwater because the rules are now more consistent with Phase II requirements.  Where HQW or ORW watersheds overlap Phase II areas, the existing State Stormwater Program (Coastal, HQW, or ORW) satisfies Phase II, and the contact is the DWQ Regional Office (except in some coastal jurisdictions like Wilmington, where the city implements the coastal rules).  It is important to note here that by definition, waters classified as WS-I, WS-II, and Shellfishing (SA) waters are all HQW.  However, WS-I & WS-II are covered by the Water Supply Protection Program, implemented by the local governments and are not included in this sub-set of HQWs.  In WS-I/II areas, the local government is the contact.  The State SW Program affects:
      > Development "within a half mile and draining to" SA waters; a half mile buffer should delineate all possible areas.  Very stringent density thresholds apply here.
      > Development "within one mile of and draining to" HQW waters.  However, this criterion does not apply to WS-I, WS-II, and coastal (where many HQW are SA).
      > Development "draining to" ORW waters (statewide).  These areas may be smaller than 14-digit hydrologic units.  Note that some watersheds have special management strategies tantamount to ORW requirements.
      As of October 2008, the State Stormwater Program (Coastal and non-Coastal) requirements satisfy Phase II requirements.

      Water Supply Watershed Protection Program:
      There are different tiers of Water Supply classifications, and each carries specific stormwater requirements.  WS Protection Program stormwater requirements satisfy Phase II Post-Construction, the requirements are implemented by local governments.  The breakdown of WS watersheds and requirements follows:

      > WS-I & WS-II: Technically, these are subject to the State SW Program above, but the Water Supply Program at the local government level satisfies the HQW requirement (i.e., there is no need to get a State SW permit from the Regional Office).  Requirements will also vary based on whether the watershed is a Critical Area (CA) or Protected Area (PA).  However, where WS-I & WS-II areas overlap ORWs, both the DWQ Regional Office and the Local Government should be contacted (this is a correction from previous years, verified by J. Ventaloro of DWQ.)
      > WS-III & WS-IV: These areas are different from the State SW program above but do have stormwater requirements at the local government level.  Where WS-III & WS-IV areas overlap HQWs, ORWs, or coastal counties, both the DWQ Regional Office and the Local Government should be contacted.
      WS-I through WS-IV requirements in the WS Protection Program satisfy Phase II requirements.  Where WS-I and WS-II overlap ORWs, both State SW Program and Local Program requirements apply.  Where WS-III and WS-IV overlap HQW/ORW/Coastal Counties, both State SW Program and Local Program requirements apply.

      Lake Randleman Water Supply Protection Stormwater Requirements:
      This is essentially a ?special? subset of the WS Watershed Protection Program.  All local governments ?that have land use authority within the Randleman Lake watershed? must comply with the stormwater management rules for this program.  Both Guilford and Randolph counties implement this program; therefore, a project anywhere in the watershed is subject to this program (and some jurisdictions may implement it within ETJ even beyond the watershed).  The stormwater requirements differ based on whether the project is in the upper portion (part of Deep River watershed draining to Oakdale-Cotton Mill Dam) or lower portion (Deep River watershed upstream and draining to Randleman Lake Dam, from Oakdale-Cotton Mill Dam).  The local governments that implement this program are: Guilford & Randolph counties; and the towns of Archdale, Greensboro, High Point, Jamestown, and Randleman.
      The Lake Randleman WS Protection requirements satisfy Phase II.

      Neuse and Tar-Pamlico NSW Strategy Stormwater Management Programs:
      >The 15 largest local governments implement this program in the Neuse Basin (only portions within the basin):
      Cary, Smithfield, Durham, Wilson, Garner, Goldsboro, Havelock, Kinston, New Bern, Raleigh, as well as Orange County*, Durham County*, Johnston County*, Wake County*, and Wayne County*.

      >Six municipalities and five counties implement this in the Tar-Pamlico Basin (only portions within the basin):
      Greenville, Henderson, Oxford, Rocky Mount, Tarboro, and Washington. The counties are: Beaufort*, Edgecombe*, Franklin*, Nash*, and Pitt*.
      *Only applicable to areas under jurisdiction of respective county (i.e., unincorporated areas).
      Both the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico NSW strategy programs satisfy Phase II requirements.  However, these programs do not satisfy State SW or WS requirements.

      Lake Jordan Water Supply NSW Stormwater Management:
      These rules were finalized in August 2009 as Session Law 2009-484.  Ultimately, stormwater management requirements for new development will apply to local governments in the Jordan watershed.  For more information on which local governments currently do what, go to www.jordanlake.org.  Right now, DWQ continues to administer Phase II requirements in parts of this watershed.

      Falls Lake Water Supply NSW Stormwater Management:
      Draft rules on this strategy went out to public comment in March 2010.  Ultimately, stormwater management requirements for new development will apply to local governments in the Jordan watershed.  Right now, DWQ continues to administer Phase II requirements in parts of this watershed.

      It is important to remember that a local government may choose to pass ordinances, etc. that are above and beyond what existing stormwater programs or Phase II Post-Construction.  This is even a possibility in areas outside of Phase II areas.  Therefore, it is important to remind the user to check for specific local government requirements no matter where they are.

    It is important to remember that a local government may choose to pass ordinances that are above and beyond what existing stormwater programs or Phase II requires.  A local government may choose to pass ordiinances in areas outside of Phase II areas.  Also, city limits and extraterritorial jurisdictions (ETJ) may have changed since this dataset was created.  Also, water supply watersheds or other water quality delineations may have changed between updates of this dataset.  Therefore, users of this dataset should check for specific local government requirements to verify the information represented in this dataset.
    Acknowledgement of products derived form this data set should cite the following: The sources of the stormwater reference data are mapped at a scale of 1:24,000 or better, implying horizontal error plus or minus 40 feet.   This representation is intended as a guide to persons seeking stormwater permits and to permitting authorities.   While efforts have been made to ensure that these data are accurate and reliable within the state of the art, CGIA cannot assume liability for any damages or misrepresentation caused by any inaccuracies in the data or as a result of changes to the data caused by system transfers.

      Source_Contribution: Source layers were processed in the model to produce polygons representing stormwater permitting responsibility across the state.
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Using the ArcGIS Spatial Analyst Extension and Model Builder, a model was constructed to process 9 source layers and produce output representing stormwater permitting responsibility.
        The first model input feature is a jurisdictional boundary layer (a GIS layer that combines NC county boundaries with municipalities, ETJs (provided by NC CGIA), military boundaries, and NPDES-permitted county areas, and which was created with a smaller model constructed out of those 4 source layers).  That feature contains information about the Phase II status of municipalities, ETJs, and counties; identifies coastal counties under Coastal Area Management Act (state); and identifies areas that are federally managed (military and Coast Guard).
        The first identity feature is the urbanizing areas (according to the most recent US Census).
        The first function is an identity that computes the geometric intersection of the input feature and the identity feature; the input feature or portions thereof that overlap the identity feature will get the attributes of the identity feature.
        In a series of 8 identity functions, the output from the previous identity becomes the input feature for the next identity.
        The identity features, in sequence, are:
        Urbanizing areas (as defined by the US Bureau of the Census); municipal buffers around Phase II cities representing municipal sphere of influence (pre-processed buffers of 1-mile (municipalities with Census 2000 population below 10,000), 2-miles (population 10,000 to 24,999) and 3-mile (population 25,000 and over));  High Quality Water Outstanding Resource Water (HQW/ORW) watersheds excepting Water Supply Watersheds WS-I and WS-II; NSW Strategy areas including the Neuse and Tar-Pamlico Programs; Water Supply Watersheds; Special Watersheds including areas like Goose Creek and Jordan Reservoir, which dictate specific stormwater requirements; SA areas defined by 1/2-mile around all SA waters; and finally all areas subject to "Phase II" per Session Law 2006-246.
        Further editing of special cases are necessary to accurately address all areas of the state (for example, changing contacts where local governments are delegated authority to implement Phase II stormwater requirements).

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        The output shapefile from the model contained fields from all of the source files.  The desired output needed a set of 8 meaningful fields that retain the appropriate values from the series of identities.

        ModelBuilder:  Set up 8 identities in sequence

        Validate Entire Model

        Run Entire Model

        Identity_8_phase2area.shp has 4,545 polygons

        Export copy of data set to SWref2010mmdd_final_identity.shp

        Add new fields:

        PERMITTING (10), TYPE (35), BASIS (40), NOTE (40), CONTACT (45), CATEGORY (50), DENR_RGN (30), and PH2_INFO (40).

        Carry these exisiting fields through:

        COUNTY (15), JURISDIC (150) >> shortened to JURISDIC (40) in final layer

        Some text revisions necessary depending on input file records and have been documented by the Stormwater Permitting Unit.

        Calculate values of the new fields in the output shapefile by using Pre-logic VBA code scripts for specific fields.
        For SWref2010mmdd_final_identity.shp, the following script describes how each field was calculated for each scenario.  (Note some fields used in the calculations will be dropped in the final reference layer):

        /*New Jordan Lake Watershed SW Rules*/

        Jordan Watershed areas that direct to State b/c of Phase II may need to be changed to redirect to Local
        Program after PERMITTING field calculated, but this may not be appropriate until future updates ~ 2012
        to time with local ordinances.  Right now, just identify watershed in Step 7. and direct user to URL:
        www.jordanlake.org (map).  A similar scenario may hold for Falls Lake Watershed.

        Select records:
        WHERE("DESCRIPT_1" = "Jordan Reservoir Watershed" AND ("PERMITTING" = "None" OR "TYPE" = "Water Supply

        Modify some fields for Designated Phase II cities.  Add designation status info, and note that DWQ will
        permit projects in Phase II areas (tipped, UA, MSI, etc.) until local program begins.  (Where non-Phase II,
        non-coastal, Post-Construction begins when local government impelments its program.)

        Also select records for Designated Cities where local WS or NSW programs (for example) are not currently
        satisfying the Phase II requirement and set this field to:
        [PH2_INFO] = "Local prog eventually to satisfy Ph II"

        Also select records for Designated Cities on the coast where the [CONTACT] should include the Regional

        Make ETJs of these cities consistent.  In 2010, only affects Clayton, Zebulon, and Wendell.

        Go back and populate the DENR_RGN for those records because they were left blank in source file wherever CAMA = 'n/a'.

        Identify special cases where local governments have been delegated authority.  Several fields need to be changed for specific records.
        Includes areas in: GASTON, GUILFORD, MECKLENBURG, DURHAM, BUNCOMBE, CHATHAM, AND WAKE counties.  Also address implmentation issue in
        CALDWELL COUNTY (DWQ/Lenoir current contacts).  Note - delegations do NOT necessarily extend into areas that are HQW/ORW (and remain
        state-permitting) or change local Water Supply program contacts.

        Revise contact fields for ORW areas on coast where user should go to local Phase II jurisdiction (like in Wilminton), instead of regional office.
