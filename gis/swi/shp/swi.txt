  Description:
    Abstract:
      The North Carolina Department of Environment, Health, and Natural
      Resources, Division of Water Quality, in cooperation with the NC Center
      for Geographic Information and Analysis, developed the GIS data set,
      Surface Water Intakes to enhance planning, siting and impact analysis
      in areas directly affecting water supply intakes in North Carolina.  The
      file enables users to identify point locations where communities draw raw
      water from a lake, river, or stream; treat it; and distribute treated
      water to residences and businesses in North Carolina.  The original
      locations were developed by the DEHNR-Div of Environmental Health,
      Public Water Supply Branch in April of 1990.  Locations have been
      altered, added and deleted by the Division of Water Quality who
      updates this file in accordance with the Water Supply Watersheds
      file. This file is updated as changes occur.
    Purpose:
      This data was created to assist governmental agencies and others
      in making resource management decisions through use of a Geographic
      Information System (GIS).

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      Public Water Supply lat/long
      coordinates were obtained by NC CGIA and plotted onto 1:100,000-scale
      format base maps with 1:100,000-scale hydrography to verify accuracy.
      They were attributed with a PWSB identification numbers supplied by
      the source agency.  Intakes were edited on the screen, if necessary.
      Intake points have been repositioned by DEHNR,DWQ,WQS as they are
      updated.  The IDs are checked for consistency.  This digital file
      is currently updated as changes occur.
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Using ESRI's ARC/INFO GIS software, the
    dataset was built for points using the 'build' command.  Topology has
    not been edited since the last build or clean.
  Completeness_Report:
    These data represent the locations where
    communities draw raw water from a lake, river, or stream, treat it,
    and distribute treated water to residences and businesses, as deter-
    mined by the Water Quality Section of the Div of Water Quality.

      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        Surface water intakes were marked on USGS 30 x 60 Minute series
        topographic base maps, which meet National Map Accuracy Standards,
        using a best estimate with reference to surrounding features.
