  Description:
    Abstract: The NC DENR Ecosystem Enhancement Program (EEP) Watershed Planning Section identifies Targeted Local Watersheds (TLWs) during development of River Basin Restoration Plans (RBRPs).  RBRPs are a broad examination of river basins (1000-10,000 mi2) and their component Catalog Units (CUs) (500-2000 mi2). RBRPs are typically completed every five years and identify priority 14-digit HUs, or Targeted Local Watersheds (TLWs), in each of the states 17 major river basins that represent areas where the need and opportunity for stream, buffer and wetlands restoration are well documented, and where local water quality and habitat restoration or protection projects can do the most good. RBRPs build upon and are complemented by the N.C. Division of Water Quality (DWQ) Basinwide Water Quality Plans. RBRPs use GIS to analyze the best available data describing watershed problems (e.g., need for water quality improvement) and assets (e.g., natural heritage areas) at the 14-digit watershed scale. HUs are then compared across the river basin or CU to identify priority HUs to restore, enhance and protect (i.e., TLWs). RBRPs can also help identify HUs in which to initiate a Local Watershed Plan.
    Purpose: The purpose of this theme is to provide the set of watersheds that identify existing EEP Targeted Local Watersheds.
    Supplemental_Information:
      The Ecosystem Enhancement Program issues a companion GIS theme representing Local Watershed Plan areas, a subset of TLWs.  The boundaries for watersheds are based on 14-digit hydrologic units (hunc.shp).  See the Cross References section for details.
      The following is an excerpt from the "North Carolina Hydrologic Unit River Basin Study," USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service, November 1995. Under the sponsorship of the Water Resources Council,
      a nationally uniform hydrologic unit system was developed in 1974 by the US Geological Survey's Office of Water Data
      Coordination. This system divides the country into 21 regions, 222 subregions, 352 accounting units, and 2,149 cataloging units, based on surface hydrologic features.  A hierarchical code consisting of two digits for each of the above four levels combine to form an eight-digit hydrologic unit. The hydrologic unit system is used to identify any hydrologic area of interest. An eight-digit hydrologic unit generally covers 700 or more square miles.
      In 1978, the USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) issued a policy that all resource inventories and surveys were to be coded with and capable of being retrieved by hydrologic unit codes (HUCs).  At about the same time, NRCS initiated a national program to further subdivide HUCs into watershed-sized areas (nominally 250,000 acres, or 390 square miles) for use in water resource planning.  An extension of three digits was added to the eight-digit HUC to designate sub-watersheds, thus forming elevin-digit HUCs.  This 1995 Hydrologic Unit (HU) Study divides the state river
      basins and subbasins into smaller fourteen-digit hydrologic units that will be useful in targeting project activities, resource
      inventories, and reporting conservation activities. These fourteen-digit hydrologic units of approximately 4,000 acres
      (6 sqare miles) to 50,000 acres (78 square miles) are small enough in size to be useful as a planning and reporting tool
      for the USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and other government and state agencies.
      This 1995 fourteen-digit HU map will replace the 1974 eight-digit HU map [U.S. Water Resource Council (WRC)] and the 1978 NRCS eleven-digit HU map as the locating tool for planning in NRCS.  The 1995 HU map were produced using 7.5 minute USGS quadrangle base maps (1:24,000 scale).

      NOTE: The subbasin 6-digit code (SUBBASIN#) was developed independently from the hydrologic unit codes, from an entirely different numbering system.  (Example of code: 03-03-01.)  The first two numbers identify the river basin designations adopted by the Environmental Protection Agency. (Date of source: 1974.)  Subbasin boundaries were added within individual river basin boundaries (by the office that is now known as the Division of Water Quality, Water Quality Planning Section).  Sequential numbers (example -01) were added by DWQ to the first four-digit EPA code to give each subbasin a unique six-digit identifier.  (Each subbasin incorporates three or more hydrologic units.  The subbasin boundaries have been modified to be coincident with the hydrologic unit boundaries.)
      Contact DWQ for more information on the subbasin# code (733-5083).

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: The USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service delineated the hydrologic units for North Carolina on 24k USGS topographic maps.  These boundaries were attributed with USDA-NRCS classification information, acres per polygon, and square miles per polygon.  The digital files were plotted and overlayed to the originals and linework and label corrections were made. Once complete and under the direction of DENR-DWQ, the digital file was further defined by subbasins derived from HUs and the river basins derived by subbasins. Appropiate ids were added to the attribute files.  Attribute accuracy is considered high. There are no lookup tables, annotation or cartosets for this data.
  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    Using ESRI's ARC/INFO GIS software, the data set of watershed boundaries was built for arc and polygon topology using the "build" command. The data set was then cleaned with a fuzzy tolerance of 1 foot.  Topology has not been edited since the last build or clean.
    The Ecosystem Enhancement Program selected hydrologic units relating to Targeted Local Watersheds and added fields to describe them.
  Completeness_Report: These data depict the boundaries and unit numbers from the USDA-NRCS Hydrologic Unit River Basin Study, 1995. The study divides the state river basins into subbasins used to track resource and conservation activities.  The Ecosystem Enhancement Program is a statewide program and completed initial work on the attributes in early 2004.  The data was last updated 11/30/2009.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Hydrologic Units were delineated on USGS 1:24,000 paper topographic maps by following contour lines.  HU codes were written onto the topo maps for later attribute coding.  All topo maps within the Coastal Area Management Act (CAMA) area were given to CGIA for digitization. All other topos across the state were given to Westinghouse-Landmark GIS, Inc. for digitization. The USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service delineated the hydrologic units for North Carolina on 24k USGS topographic maps.  The digital files were plotted by CGIA and
        overlayed to the originals and reviewed by staff at NRCS and DENR-DWQ. Needed corrections were made. Once an agreed upon, digital file was created.  DWQ assisted NRCS in modifying certain boundaries which were not at the time coincident with the subbasins that DWQ manages. After that was completed, NRCS met with officials from neighboring states (Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee) to edgematch the Hydrologic Unit boundaries across the state line. This was done to the 11-digit boundary, not the 14-digit.  Once this file was complete, DWQ assisted CGIA in establishing new subbasin boundaries derived from HU boundaries, and then established new river basin boundaries derived from subbasin boundaries.  This digital file is updated as changes occur.
      Process_Date: 19941130
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Hydrologic units were digitized from hand delineated boundaries on USGS 7.5 Minute series paper base maps.  The digital files were attributed and checkplots were created for review by the Natural Resources Conservation Service and the NC Division of Water Quality. Necessary corrections were made and new plots were run.
        Post processing involved edgematching and mapjoining of USGS 7.5 Minute series maps used to create the digitized data.  This process generated one statewide polygon coverage.  CGIA updates the digital file as needed.
      Process_Date: 19960415
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Delineated hydrologic unit boudaries on 24k topographic maps were given to Westinghouse-Landmark GIS, Inc. by the NRCS. The HU boundaries were hand-digitized and combined into on file.  After some review by NRCS and DWQ, this file was given to NCCGIA where it was joined to the existing 24 counties of coastal HU data.  This file was then checked by NRCS and DWQ staff. Corrections were made.
