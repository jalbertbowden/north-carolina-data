  Description:
    Abstract: This set of boundaries represent Township Boundaries and other Minor Civil Divisions as released by the US Bureau of the Census as cartographic boundary files based on Census 2000 geography.  Statistical data are not joined to these boundaries.
    Purpose: The purpose of this data set is to provide approximate township boundaries and other minor civil divisions as a context for other GIS themes and as a reference for statistical data from Census 2000.
    Supplemental_Information:
      These are cartographic boundary files, not at the same scale as TIGER/Line 2000 boundaries.
      Minor civil divisions (MCDs) are the primary governmental or administrative divisions of a county or county equivalent in many states. MCDs represent many different kinds of legal entities with a wide variety of governmental and/or administrative functions. MCDs are variously designated as American Indian reservations, assessment districts, boroughs, charter townships, election districts, election precincts, gores, grants, locations, magisterial districts, parish governing authority districts, plantations, precincts, purchases, road districts, supervisor's districts, towns, and townships. In some states, all or some incorporated places are not located in any MCD (independent places) and thus serve as MCDs in their own right. In other states, incorporated places are part of the MCDs in which they are located (dependent places), or the pattern is mixed- some incorporated places are independent of MCDs and others are included within one or more MCDs. Independent cities, which are statistically equivalent to a county, also are treated as a separate MCD equivalent in states containing MCDs. In Maine and New York, there are American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands that serve as MCD equivalents; a separate MCD is created in each case where the American Indian area crosses a county boundary.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: Accuracy of the boundaries and township names have not been verified.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: Data were downloaded from www.census.gov as a cartographic boundary file in shapefile format.
  Completeness_Report: The data cover all of North Carolina
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: Boundaries are less accurate than TIGER/Line 2000 boundaries.  The cartographic boundary files are primarily designed for small scale, thematic mapping applications at a target scale range of 1:500,000 to 1:5,000,000.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: The cartographic boundary files are a generalized extract from the U.S. Census Bureau's TIGER database. Line simplification/smoothing was performed with a tolerance of 0.005 decimal degrees and a coordinate reduction using the Douglas-Peucker method with a tolerance of 0.0003 decimal degrees. Very small polygons were eliminated when the combination of geographic codes existed elsewhere. The geography was clipped back to the shoreline of the United States, in contrast to TIGER/Line® which shows the full extent of geography out to the 3-mile limit.
