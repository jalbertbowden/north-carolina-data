  Description:
    Abstract:
      The NC-CGIA developed the digital GIS Wild and Scenic Rivers data set
      from the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System website information
      (http://www.rivers.gov).
      The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act established a method for providing
      Federal protection for certain of our country's remaining free-flowing
      rivers, preserving them and their immediate environments for the use
      and enjoyment of present and future generations.  Rivers are included
      in the system so that they may benefit from the protective management
      and control of development for which the Act provides.
    Purpose:
      This data was created to assist governmental agencies and others in
      making resource management decisions through use of a Geographic
      Information System (GIS).

    Supplemental_Information:
      Wild and Scenic River descriptions from the National Wild and Scenic
      Rivers System website: (North Carolina rivers - http://www.rivers.gov/wildriverslist.html#nc)
      Horsepasture River:
      From Bohaynee Road (N.C. 281) downstream to Lake Jocassee.
      (Scenic - 3.6 miles; Recreational - 0.6 miles; Total - 4.2 miles)
      Lumber River:
      The segments currently designated are from State Route 1412/1203
      (river mile 0) to the Scotland/Robeson County lines at the end of
      the Maxton Airport Swamp (river mile 22) and from Back Swamp
      (river mile 56) to the North Carolina/South Carolina border (river
      mile 115).  (Scenic - 60.0 miles; Recreational - 21.0 miles; Total -
      81 miles)
      South Fork New River:
      The South Fork from its confluence with Dog Creek downstream 22 miles
      to the confluence with the North Fork.  The main stem from the
      confluence of the North and South Forks with Dog Creek downstream
      approximately 4.5 miles to the Virginia state line.  (26.5 miles
      total - all Scenic)
      Wilson Creek:
      From the headwaters below Calloway Peak to the confluece with Johns
      River.  (Wild - 4.6 miles; Scenic - 2.9 miles; Recreational - 15.8 miles;
      Total - 23.3 miles)
      (Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina rivers - http://www.rivers.gov/wildriverslist.html#ga_nc_sc):
      Chatooga River:
      From 0.8 miles below Cashiers Lake to the North Carolina/South Carolina
      border.  (9.3 miles total - NOTE: mileasge is not broken down for
      NC segment of river)

      2.) filename: wsrivers0508  The May 13, 2008 version update:
      A) Replacement of existing stream segments with 1:24,000-scale stream data.
      (Original version was generated from 1:100,000-scale data.)
      B) Addition of Chattooga River in Jackson County.  (This description was
      overlooked in the first version of the data.  All other descriptions were
      listed under 'North Carolina'.  This description was listed under
      'Georgia, North Carolina & South Carolina'.)
      C) Removal of miles attribute - with the multiple 1:24,000-scale
      stream segments and double-banked lines, this item is not longer useful.
