  Description:
    Abstract: Areas of North Carolina where local governments are required to adopt and implement water supply watershed protection ordinances, maps, and a management plans. Refer to http://portal.ncdenr.org/web/wq/swp/ws/wswp for more information on this program. The original polygons were delineated using paper USGS topographic maps. Starting in 2009 new water supply watershed boundaries were delineated using the watershed boundary dataset as a base. Older boundaries have not been updated to match the watershed boundary dataset.
    Purpose: Data set should be used in conjunction with water quality classifications to identify areas were water supply watershed protection programs are required. Not all areas are strictly watersheds but stop at an upstream limit that is not a complete drainage area delineation.

  Overview_Description:
    Entity_and_Attribute_Overview:
      Water Supply I (WS-I)

      Waters protected for all Class C uses plus waters used as sources of water supply for drinking, culinary, or food processing purposes for those users desiring maximum protection for their water supplies. WS-I waters are those within natural and undeveloped watersheds in public ownership. All WS-I waters are HQW by supplemental classification. More information: Water Supply Watershed Protection Program Homepage
      Water Supply II (WS-II)

      Waters used as sources of water supply for drinking, culinary, or food processing purposes where a WS-I classification is not feasible. These waters are also protected for Class C uses. WS-II waters are generally in predominantly undeveloped watersheds.  All WS-II waters are HQW by supplemental classification. More information: Water Supply Watershed Protection Program Homepage
      Water Supply III (WS-III)

      Waters used as sources of water supply for drinking, culinary, or food processing purposes where a more protective WS-I or II classification is not feasible. These waters are also protected for Class C uses. WS-III waters are generally in low to moderately developed watersheds. More information: Water Supply Watershed Protection Program Homepage
      Water Supply IV (WS-IV)

      Waters used as sources of water supply for drinking, culinary, or food processing purposes where a WS-I, II or III classification is not feasible. These waters are also protected for Class C uses. WS-IV waters are generally in moderately to highly developed watersheds or Protected Areas. More information: Water Supply Watershed Protection Program Homepage
      Water Supply V (WS-V)

      Waters protected as water supplies which are generally upstream and draining to Class WS-IV waters or waters used by industry to supply their employees with drinking water or as waters formerly used as water supply. These waters are also protected for Class C uses. More information: Water Supply Watershed Protection Program Homepage
