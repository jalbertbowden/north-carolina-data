  Description:
    Abstract: This set of boundaries represent Zip Code Tabulation Areas (5-digit) as released by the US Bureau of the Census as cartographic boundary files based on Census 2000 geography.  There are multiple polygons per 5-digit zip code in some cases.  Statistical data are not joined to these boundaries.
    Purpose: The purpose of this data set is to provide approximate zip code boundaries as a context for other GIS themes and as a reference for statistical data from Census 2000, Zip Code Tabulation Areas.
    Supplemental_Information: These are cartographic boundary files, not at the same scale as TIGER/Line 2000 boundaries.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: Accuracy of the boundaries and zip code designations have not been verified.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: Data were downloaded from www.census.gov as a cartographic boundary file in shapefile format.
  Completeness_Report: The data cover all of North Carolina
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report: Boundaries are less accurate than TIGER/Line 2000 boundaries.
